Provides a working forum for developing creative thinking and critical awareness in design. Further examines two-dimensional and three-dimensional representation techniques for developing and presenting design concepts. Cognition for spatial relationships present in structural, proportional, and site systems are acquired via freehand drawings, 2-D and 3-D projections, shades, shadows, perspective, and design techniques. Further enhancement of model-making skills utilizing various design media. Advanced emphasis of 2-D and 3-D projections, shades, shadows, perspectives, and reproduction techniques.  Studio projects introduce a range of assignments for the making of both 2-D and 3-D environments.  There is a fee associated with this course.","abbr":"ARC","subject":"Architecture","num":"102LAB","type_pk":"LAB","type":"Laboratory","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0226","academic_org":"0227","long_title":"Architectural Design Studio 2","min_credits":"5","max_credits":"5","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: ARC 101LAB and Architecture majors only.\nCo-Requisite: ARC 112LEC.
