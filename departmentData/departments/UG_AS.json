It begins with an examination of Jesuit missions to Japan and China, as well as the role that India played in the establishment and maintenance of these missions. The different Jesuit strategies for accommodating or rejecting indigenous religious beliefs and customs are compared and considered, as well as the Nestorians in China much earlier. Then we turn to the unique way in which Catholicism was subsequently established in Korea, where Christianity has enjoyed unparalleled success in East Asia. We will look closely at how Christianity has affected and been affected by socio-political developments, its interactions with and influence upon traditional Asian religions, its relationship to nationalism since the late 19th century, and its tensions and conflict with colonialism and Communism in the 20th century. It concludes by asking what factors might have enabled Christianity to have such success in Korea (and the Philippines) and compare these to the situation in China and Japan. This course is the same as  HIS 374 and course repeat rules will apply.  Students should consult with their major department regarding any restrictions on their degree requirements.","abbr":"AS","subject":"Asian Studies","num":"374LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"1097","long_title":"History of the Spread of Christianity in Asia","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASPSUW","fall":true,"winter":true,"spring":true,"summer":true}},"AS465":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS461":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS485":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS476":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS464":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS480":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS482":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS463":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS481":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS491":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS471":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS467":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS489":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS486":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS484":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS487":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS483":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS474":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS498":{"_id":"6186529d9c7904001eb6faec","regnum":"11005","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"AS","num":"498TUT","title":"Sr Res in Asian Studies","section":"NAT","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Nathan,Mark","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Arr Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652c69c7904001eb73b6f","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":5,"enrolled":3,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652ed9c7904001eb75ac2","sequence":1,"note":"PERMISSION OF INSTRUCTOR "}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa5b1","course_id":"003066","title":"Sr Res in Asian Studies","description":"A capstone course required for all majors in Asian Studies.

How do we understand the effects of poisons on our body? How do we make the best use of these potent matters that can benefit us and the society at large? These are some of the fundamental questions to the history of medicine, and driving ones for this course. Examining the history of poisons through twelve case studies, we will explore the complexity of poison materiality by contemplating the intimate relations between poisons, medicines, and foods. We will learn how the experiences of the body shaped the conceived values of poisons. We will examine the circulation of poison knowledge across social and geographical domains. Using specific poisons as the anchor of our analysis, we will explore the social fabric and cultural milieu in which particular ideas and practices of poisons emerged, flourished, or diminished. One key aspect of the course is to introduce a comparative perspective to the study of medical history. By studying above topics in both European/American and Asian contexts, we will identify surprising parallels, striking differences, and hidden connections between these traditions. Finally, we will ponder how knowledge of poisons in the past illuminates our notions and habits of ingesting and experiencing drugs today.

But beneath its flashy exterior, Bollywood also offers moral lessons for social uplift, provides examples of changing class and family dynamics, tracks the influence of the West on a decidedly South Asian art form, and has its finger perennially on the cultural pulse of India.","abbr":"AS","subject":"Asian Studies","num":"333LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"1097","long_title":"South Asian Cinema:  Bollywood and Beyond","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"AS330":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS276":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS350":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS313":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS346":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS314":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS332":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS341":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS364":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb723d4","regnum":"24108","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"AS","num":"364LEC","title":"Chinese Film & Visual Culture","section":"MAC","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Macdonald,Sean","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 25","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1530},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1650},"when":[{"_id":"618652d19c7904001eb74425","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1530,"end":1650},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":81,"section":30,"enrolled":7,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa596","course_id":"303064","title":"Chinese Film & Visual Culture","description":"This course is an introduction to Chinese film and visual culture from the earliest days until the present.

In particular, anime (Japanese animation), the most profitable form of Japanese popular culture, has become increasingly visible all over the world. Although anime fandom in the U.S. is anchored by several works of mass appeal, it remains a subculture whose increasingly influential devotees occupy a cultural fringe. This course introduces students to this unique subculture and introduces an academic approach to viewing the anime art form. In addition to the focus on specific genres of anime, this course will pay special attention to four influential anime directors; Oshii Mamoru, Satoshi Kon, Hosoda Mamoru and Miyazaki Hayao. This course is designed to be interactive, while it builds a rigorous understanding of the anime medium through its history, its artists, and its institutions. Not only will the course focus on critical analysis of films, it will use anime as a medium by which to study Japanese culture at large, with some attention given to production. Taught in English.","abbr":"AS","subject":"Asian Studies","num":"347LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"1097","long_title":"The Fantastical World of Japanese Anime","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FA","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"AS320":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS344":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS185":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS321":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS322":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS180":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS198":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS336":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS220":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS329":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS334":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS338":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS210":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS218":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS189":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS190":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS208":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS179":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS186":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS211":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS231":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS206":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS234":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS205":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS192":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS188":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS209":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS202":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS201":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS184":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS221":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS207":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS197":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS219":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS222":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS200":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS183":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS216":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS226":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS225":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS194":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS243":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS213":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS235":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS214":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS239":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS203":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS242":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS217":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS240":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS191":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS215":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"AS229":{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb72280","regnum":"23713","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"AS","num":"229LEC","title":"Contemp Asian Societies","section":"CAI","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Cai,Kevin G","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Academ 317","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1100},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1340},"when":[{"_id":"618652b79c7904001eb72d4a","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1100,"end":1340},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":29,"section":29,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa58b","course_id":"023928","title":"Contemp Asian Societies","description":"Introduces students to major features of societies in East, Southeast, and South Asia, and may incorporate material on Central and Southwest Asia depending on the instructor.
