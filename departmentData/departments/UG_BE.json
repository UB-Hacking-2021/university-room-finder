We will introduce biotechnologies used in the synthesis, purification and characterization of proteins and nucleic acids, such as solid phase peptide synthesis, chromatography, electrophoresis, western blotting, qRT-PCR, and DNA sequencing.","abbr":"BE","subject":"Biomedical Engineering","num":"310LR","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1536","long_title":"Biomedical Chemical Principles 2","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: BE 309 or CHE 201 or CHE 203;\nCo-Requisite: BE 202;\nApproved BE or ENS Majors Only.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"BE 309 or CHE 201 or CHE 203;","corequisites":"BE 202;\nApproved BE or ENS Majors Only","typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},{"_id":"618652a49c7904001eb70fcd","regnum":"17475","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"BE","num":"310LR","title":"BE Chem Principles 2","section":"R2","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Wu,Yun","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Alumni 90","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1500},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1550},"when":[{"_id":"618652bb9c7904001eb731ae","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1500,"end":1550},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":28,"section":27,"enrolled":3,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660416a56f200297aa61a","course_id":"019544","title":"BE Chem Principles 2","description":"Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes of living things.
