And what are the effects of consuming entertainment media? In this class, we will endeavor to answer these questions by reviewing (A) the psychological processes underlying audiences' media selection decisions, (B) factors contributing to audiences' enjoyment of media, and (C) the cognitive and behavioral effects audiences may experience after consuming entertaining media. We will review classic theories of media entertainment and more recent empirical research targeted at understanding the relationship between audiences and entertainment media."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660456a56f200297aac7d","course_id":"300046","title":"Spec Top in Mass Comm","description":"Content varies each semester.

Fundamentally, a network consists of a collection of actors and the connections amongst them.  Often the actors are individuals, but they can also be web pages, research articles, organizations, and nation states.  Each of us is embedded in a multitude of networks, connected to others by cultures, social relationships, and communication technologies.  Social Network Analysis is a collection of methods for analyzing these relational structures.  The emphasis is not on the attributes of the actors, but rather on the pattern of their connections.  Actors are defined not so much by their individual characteristics as they are by how they are related to others.  Focused as it is on the nature of the connections rather than the nature of the actors, network analysis is a perspective that cuts across the social, behavioral, and natural sciences.  It is one of the few truly interdisciplinary paradigms available today","abbr":"COM","subject":"Communication","num":"360LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0569","long_title":"Social Networks Analysis","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: COM101.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"COM101","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"COM413":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"COM361":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"COM474":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"COM482":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"COM364":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"COM479":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"COM461":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"COM473":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71eb4","regnum":"22298","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"COM","num":"473SEM","title":"Sp Top Com Theory/Research","section":"DSL","section_status":"A","alt_title":"Entrepreneurship and COM","instructor":"Lee,David S","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Clemen 17","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1100},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1220},"when":[{"_id":"618652e09c7904001eb74fe6","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1100,"end":1220},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":45,"section":45,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660456a56f200297aac71","course_id":"002668","title":"Sp Top Com Theory/Research","description":"Content varies each semester.

Is screen-time bad for kids? Has technology ruined our ability to interact face-to-face with others? Is Instagram making us sad? Is Netflix making us lazy? Are media ruining our lives? \n\nMoral panic, or the fear that something will harm others¿ well-being, has ensued after the adoption of nearly every popular new technology. Just like some modern citizens worry that social media, video games, and screen-time will cause irreparable harm to vulnerable users, some historical citizens voiced concerns over the dangerous effects of comic books, radio, and even regular old books. \n\nIn this course, we will examine the moral panic surrounding new technologies and modern media. We will read popular press articles that highlight the moral panic surrounding different media, discuss what is driving public concern on the topic, and then we will turn to science: What does science say about Netflix binges, social media trolling, and violent video games? Are people right to be concerned about their effects? How do we know? We will consider the positive and negative sides of media¿s role in our day-to-day lives, and look to see whether we can determine a net effect ¿ that is, all things considered, are media helping or hurting society at large? \n\nDrawing on research across the social sciences, the goal of this course is not only to consider scientific understandings of media¿s influence on society, but also to teach students the research and critical thinking skills necessary to consider similar big questions and seek out credible answers on their own. This course aims to foster media literacy skills that will benefit students throughout their college years and future careers."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660456a56f200297aac46","course_id":"301339","title":"UB Seminar","description":"The three credit UB Seminar is focused on a big idea or challenging issue to engage students with questions of significance in a field of study and, ultimately, to connect their studies with issues of consequence in the wider world.
