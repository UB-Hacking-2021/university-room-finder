Additional topics include the use of recursion, multithreading, parallelism, hardware, graph and tree traversals, asymptotic analysis, divide and conquer, databases, testing, and multi-language integration.","abbr":"CSE","subject":"Computer Science & Engineering","num":"116LLB","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1079","long_title":"Introduction to Computer Science II","min_credits":"4","max_credits":"4","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: CSE 115 or EAS 230 or EAS 240 or EAS 999TRCP.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"CSE 115 or EAS 230 or EAS 240 or EAS 999TRCP","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASPSU","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":true}}]},"CSE335":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE449":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE339":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE338":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE355":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE450":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE436":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE299":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE316":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE460":{"_id":"618652a79c7904001eb717c7","regnum":"19876","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CSE","num":"460LEC","title":"Data Models and Query Language","section":"000","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Das Bhattacharjee,Sreyasee","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Nsc 201","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1100},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1220},"when":[{"_id":"618652e09c7904001eb74fcf","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1100,"end":1220},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":262,"section":30,"enrolled":13,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660466a56f200297aad1a","course_id":"301978","title":"Data Models and Query Language","description":"The course focuses on the issues of data models and query languages that are relevant for building present-day database applications, covering both well-established and cutting-edge frameworks.

Codes are used ubiquitously in communication systems and data storage. The study of error correcting codes (or coding theory) started with the seminal works of Shannon and Hamming in the late 1940s and has been an active cross-disciplinary research area since then. This course will discuss the theoretical aspects of codes and will focus mostly on the worst-case noise model pioneered by Hamming. However, we will discuss quite a few results on the stochastic noise model pioneered by Shannon. The course will roughly cover three parts: (i) combinatorial aspects of codes, i.e. the limit of what can and cannot be achieved with codes; (ii) computationally efficient algorithms for using codes; and (ii) application of codes in theoretical computer science. Major developments in coding theory since the 1990s will be emphasized. This course is dual listed with CSE 545.","abbr":"CSE","subject":"Computer Science & Engineering","num":"445LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1079","long_title":"Coding Theory","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisites: CSE 331.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"CSE 331","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"CSE153":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE487":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE471":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE149":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE143":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE268":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE157":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE496":{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb703d3","regnum":"13683","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CSE","num":"496TUT","title":"Internship/Practicum","section":"KEN","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Kennedy,Oliver","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Arr Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652eb9c7904001eb75968","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":" "}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":10,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f29c7904001eb75f0e","sequence":1,"note":"Please use the force registration system (https://academics.eng.buffalo.edu/force-registration/request) for CSE 496 registration."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660466a56f200297aad2d","course_id":"004880","title":"Internship/Practicum","description":"Field experience working on a computer science project in a real-world setting under the joint direction of a supervisor from industry and internship coordinator from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

It introduces computer systems from a programmer's perspective, rather than a system implementer's perspective, which prepares students for more advanced topics that discuss the internals of a computer system (e.g., operating systems or computer architecture). As a result, the focus of the course is teaching programmable interfaces of a computer system as well as how to use them correctly and effectively when writing a program. The topics mainly include hardware/software interfaces (e.g., data representation in memory) and OS/application interfaces (e.g., syscalls).

It begins with the definition of the blockchain as a trust layer over the internet for working with distributed resources with decentralized and disintermediated control. Topics include: Definition of a blockchain in terms of transactions, blocks and chain of blocks, data structures enabling the blockchain protocol and operational details involving algorithms and techniques such as peer-to-peer transactions, cryptography, digital signing and hashing, and consensus mechanisms. All of these concepts will be illustrated using Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain. In the second part of the course, we introduce the concept of code execution the blockchain and the program module called smart contract and a language, Solidity, for writing smart contracts, compiling, deploying and testing the smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. In the last part of the course, we introduce a decentralized application (Dapp) stack and explore problem solving using blockchain. This involves design and development of a Dapp stack with the computational logic represented by the smart contract code, a user interface and support for external data access through oracles, and decentralized file systems. Students will work on hands-on end-to-end Dapp projects using Ethereum blockchain and Truffle integrated development environment (IDE). The course will also discuss standards, best practices, and current challenges, such as scalability and interoperability, and the respective solutions. This course is dual-listed with CSE 526.","abbr":"CSE","subject":"Computer Science & Engineering","num":"426LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1079","long_title":"Blockchain Application Development","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: CSE 250.
