These methods include supervised learning for regression and classification, ridge regression estimator, the lasso regression estimator, random forest, dimensionality reduction, unsupervised learning methods of clustering, and natural language processing and data scraping as part of data collection. The course introduces students to these methods primarily using Stata and the integration of Stata with Python.
