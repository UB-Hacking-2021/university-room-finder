Jane Austen, the Brontes, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Anthony Trollope, Thomas Hardy: these are just a few of these authors that made the nineteenth century literature the golden age of the British novel, in general, and of British realism, in particular. This course will explore novelistic fiction of the 1800s to ask what exactly makes realism realistic. We will thus ask what about these texts encourages us to imagine we're reading about real people with thoughts, feelings, and histories much like our own. We will also examine what makes them unrealistic though more in the sense of what violates the illusion of realism. What, in other words, makes us aware of the fact that we're not actually observing real people acting autonomously in the world but characters in a text?","abbr":"ENG","subject":"English","num":"324LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0167","long_title":"Nineteenth-Century British Novel","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"ENG287":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ENG286":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ENG319":{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb7219e","regnum":"23451","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ENG","num":"319LEC","title":"Eighteenth-C Literature","section":"ALF","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Alff,David Michael","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Cooke 114","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1530},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1650},"when":[{"_id":"618652c69c7904001eb73b87","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1530,"end":1650},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":35,"section":35,"enrolled":5,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660486a56f200297ab279","course_id":"015549","title":"Eighteenth-C Literature","description":"The content of this course is variable as specified in particular course sections and therefore it is repeatable for credit.

These are the guiding questions behind this courses survey of English verse written between 1660 and 1800. We will study poems both as self-conscious aesthetic objects possessing certain rhetorical and metrical properties, and as vehicles for public expression. Class discussion and writing assignments will stress the techniques of formal analysis, close reading skills that students can use to make sense of poetic texts from any period. Keeping in mind the mutually-generative relationship between text and cultural context, we will ask why poets adapted certain poetic forms to articulate positions on contemporary issues. How does Alexander Pope's use of heroic couplets contribute to his vanquishment of literary opponents in The Dunciad? Why does James Grainger draw upon the Virgilian tradition of georgic poetry to salute commercial productivity in the Caribbean?  For example 319C: Prof. R. Mack, Culture in 18th Century Britain What is culture and what does it means to study it? We'll answer this question first by turning to the 18th century in Britain and France when the concept of culture (if not the term itself) came into being. We'll look at the ways in which writers began to study the customs and habits of other societies and of their own societies. Our texts for doing so will be diverse. We'll examine closely literature, travel writing, history, and philosophy. In doing so we'll be especially concerned with the difficulties that arose when writers attempted to understand cultural differences and with the ways in which they called on different kind of writing to represent those differences. How do you distinguish between actions informed by religious belief and actions informed by habit? To what extent can you believe what you see is not clouded by your own beliefs and opinion? What are the criteria for comparing one culture to another? Writers in the eighteenth century asked these questions and it will be central to our project in the course to compare their earlier answers with later answers in anthropology and literature.","abbr":"ENG","subject":"English","num":"319LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0167","long_title":"Eighteenth Century Literature","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"ENG316":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ENG320":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ENG276":{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb72198","regnum":"23445","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ENG","num":"276LEC","title":"Literature and Law","section":"STU","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"McDonald,Macy Renae","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Talbrt 106","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1400},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1450},"when":[{"_id":"618652c69c7904001eb73b89","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1450},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":true,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MWF"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":30,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660486a56f200297ab268","course_id":"008298","title":"Literature and Law","description":"What stories can law tell?

This course will encourage students to consider the nature of that authenticity: how the writers use of language helps produce, challenge, or resist the representations of the phenomena she creates.

We will be listening for ways to extend the possibilities of the poem; we will pay close attention to issues of process, craft, and vision.

Toklas, and what he says about her in A Moveable Feast. We might gaze upon some of her sentences written in the teens, note their swing, their simplicity, and see that same thing in early Hemingway.  For example: N. Schmitz, Hemingway/Stein/Faulkner Triple trio, a concert of early modern masters of American literature, three writers, three works each. Ernest Hemingway: In Our Time, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and A Farewell to Arms. Gertrude Stein: Tender Buttons, Lifting Belly, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, William Faulkner: Go Down, Moses (counts as three). Pam Laws, Floridian soul singer, gives us her angry version of the hymn Go Down, Moses.

For example: Prof. J. Frakes: The Middle Ages on Film When one thinks of medievalist films, Monty Pythons Holy Grail or Heath Ledger in A Knights Tale or Richard Gere in First Knight might come to mind. Interestingly, many if not most serious and important film directors have almost from the beginning of the art form made at least one major medievalist film: Lang, Bergman, Eisenstein, Bresson, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, Herzog, Greenaway, and of course Terry Gilliam. Spanning the history of film-making, these medievalist films more often than not provide insight into the filmmakers conception of history and of contemporary politics and social issues far more than of a particular attempt to `recreate the Middle Ages on film. A survey of medievalist film-making is a survey of twentieth-century political and social movements and in fact also a survey of the history of film-making. In this course we will conduct a comparative study of a broad range of medieval literature and film representations of the Middle Ages from Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, with a focus on the social function of the texts and films in their contemporary historical contexts.  For example: Prof. A. Spiegel, American Genre Films Some of the most durable and popular stories ever told have been presented in a variety of American genre films. This semester the emphasis will be on Fantasy: Horror and Science Fiction, Musicals, Swashbucklers, Martial Arts, and some of the dreamier specimens of Film Noir; works like The Bride of Frankenstein, Blade Runner, Singin in the Rain, The Prisoner of Zenda, Blue Velvet, Enter the Dragon, and more. How much realism can be squirreled into an escapist format? We'll find out.  For example: Prof. Joan Copjec: Post-War Image The flight from urban centers, which began after WWII in the U.S., was preceded by a new category of film set exclusively in claustrophobic but eerily empty urban spaces. These films  which came to be known as noir or black films coincided not only with the collapse of the urban dream of sociality and technological perfection, but also with the collapse of the institution that manufactured and sold that dream to a delighted public: the Hollywood studio system. In Europe, too but first of all in Italy cinema took an unprecedented turn: toward neo-realism. In the first part of the course we will examine classic examples of film noir genre and neo-realism to see how they joined social problems and urban space to a new conception of the cinematic image. In the second part of the course we will examine the legacy of film noir and neo-realism in more recent films in which social problems are once again conceived as problems of urban coexistence and its failures to provide suitable modes of habitation for a diverse population. We will discuss the exponential rise of slums throughout the world and how IMF has gutted local economies while pretending to help struggling countries get back on their economic feet. The political struggles that have come to divide cities along racial and ethnic lines -- in Paris, Jerusalem, and L.A., particularly -- will be discussed alongside films that depict these divisions. We will attend to appreciation of the cinematic innovations and aesthetic breakthroughs which the films themselves invent in order to put these images on screen. Finally, we will discuss how the institutions of cinema, including international film festivals, play a role in defining these urban locations.","abbr":"ENG","subject":"English","num":"379LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0167","long_title":"Film Genres","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"ENG372":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ENG371":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ENG368":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ENG375":{"_id":"6186529f9c7904001eb70178","regnum":"12989","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ENG","num":"375LEC","title":"Heaven, Hell & Judgement","section":"CHR","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Christian,Diane R","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1830},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2110},"when":[{"_id":"618652c69c7904001eb73a96","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1830,"end":2110},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":90,"enrolled":14,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660486a56f200297ab2a5","course_id":"018941","title":"Heaven, Hell & Judgement","description":"Examination of the iconography and literature of the sacred tradition in art.

We will begin with the oldest known story of the underworld, five-thousand year-old Sumerian goddess Inannas descent From the Great Above to the Great Below. We'll look at the Egyptian weighing of the soul at death against the feather of Maat or justice, at Odysseus and Aeneas explorations of the worlds of the dead, at Plato's and popular ideas of what's next. We'll also consider Biblical apocalypses, Sheol, Hades and heaven, medieval journeys to heaven and hell, Dante's Inferno and Paradiso, and Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. We'll look at paintings, mosaics, and sculptures of Judgment, heaven and hell, including especially some Byzantine art, Romanesque churches, Giotto, Signorelli, Michaelangelo, and Bosch. We'll close with the 1946 classic film, A Matter of Life or Death, released in America as Stairway to Heaven. Through these verbal and visual imaginations we'll explore ethical and religious ideas of the judgment of good and evil, punishment and reward.
