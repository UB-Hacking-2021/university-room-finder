The approaches presented in this class are from the levels of manufacturing, machine and systems, as well as the overall product lifecycle and supply chain perspective. The main goal of this course is to help students understand the importance of green and sustainable manufacturing. The course will discuss some practical aspects of sustainability and green engineering with students and encourage them to look at the processes and systems around them more carefully and think about opportunities to improve, reuse, replacement and reduction of the environmental impacts of the processes, systems, and behaviors.  This course is the same as MAE 421 and course repeat rules will apply.  Students should consult with their major department regarding any restrictions on their degree requirements.","abbr":"IE","subject":"Industrl & Systems Engineering","num":"421LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"0309","long_title":"Sustainable Manufacturing","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"IE438":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE408":{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb7038d","regnum":"13610","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"IE","num":"408LEC","title":"Quality Assurance","section":"000","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Kelly III,Harrison W","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Nsc 215","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1230},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1350},"when":[{"_id":"618652e19c7904001eb75109","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1230,"end":1350},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":150,"section":58,"enrolled":35,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604c6a56f200297ab8bb","course_id":"018781","title":"Quality Assurance","description":"Familiarizes students with the application of statistical quality problem-solving methodologies used to characterize, leverage, and reduce process variability.
