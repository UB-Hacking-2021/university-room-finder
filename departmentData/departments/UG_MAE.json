Fundamentals methods of kinematics and kinetics for a system of particles are presented with applications to physical systems. This discussion is followed by the development of equations of motion of a rigid body, including the study of torque free motion and conservation principles. Constrained motion is discussed briefly along with a short study of impulsive motion.  The concept of equilibrium points for dynamical systems is introduced and methods of linear analysis are discussed in conjunction with linearization about the equilibrium point.
