financial decision making in an international context. Focuses on implementing analytical tools and theory through problems and analysis of real-world global decision making. From this global perspective, explores the following traditional areas of corporate finance: investments, capital budgeting, cost of capital and financial structure, evaluation and control of operations and risk management. Within these areas, we concentrate on those decision variables that purely domestic firms tend to overlook, such as fluctuating exchange rates, differing rates of inflation between countries, differing tax systems, exchange controls, segmented capital markets, and such political risks as nationalization and expropriation.","abbr":"MGF","subject":"Management Finance","num":"403LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0377","academic_org":"0799","long_title":"International Financial Management","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"MGQ 301, MGF 301, junior or senior standing in accounting or business administration majors.","requisites":"MGQ 301, MGF 301, junior or senior standing in accounting or business administration majors","prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASP","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"MGF417":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGF404":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGF406":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGF413":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGF405":{"total":4,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"6186529d9c7904001eb6fbdc","regnum":"11317","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"MGF","num":"405LEC","title":"Adv Corp Finance","section":"S2F","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Unknown","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Jacobs B32","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1830},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2110},"when":[{"_id":"618652d39c7904001eb74596","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1830,"end":2110},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":40,"section":40,"enrolled":2,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f79c7904001eb762cc","sequence":1,"note":"PREREQ MGF 301; JR STAND "}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604f6a56f200297ac066","course_id":"003684","title":"Adv Corp Finance","description":"The objective of the course is to extend and put into practice the basic financial principles and tools developed in the introductory finance class, MGF 301.
