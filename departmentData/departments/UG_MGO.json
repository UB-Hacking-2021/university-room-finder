The service sector is the largest and the fastest-growing sector in terms of contributions to GDP as well as employment. This course is designed to cover unique aspects of service operations and complexities involved in a wide range of service organizations such as health care, financial services, hotels, restaurants, education, retail, and government. The planning and control mechanisms for a variety of service situations, and ways and means to lower the costs and boost the revenue, to achieve efficient, effective, and quality-oriented service operations will be analyzed through many quantitative models, such as queuing theory and revenue and pricing optimization, and qualitative methods.","abbr":"MGO","subject":"Management Operations Analysis","num":"304LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0377","academic_org":"0382","long_title":"Service Operations Management","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: MGQ 201 and junior standing in the School of Management.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"MGQ 201 and junior standing in the School of Management","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}}]},"MGO332":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO341":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO344":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO329":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO325":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO351":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO371":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO382":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO368":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MGO330":{"total":3,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"6186529d9c7904001eb6fbfe","regnum":"11361","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"MGO","num":"330LEC","title":"Entrepreneurship & Sm Bus","section":"S1O","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Murdock III,Thomas M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Clemen 04","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1530},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1650},"when":[{"_id":"618652e19c7904001eb750a1","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1530,"end":1650},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":45,"section":45,"enrolled":8,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660506a56f200297ac12b","course_id":"001687","title":"Entrepreneurship & Sm Bus","description":"What's your big idea?

The objectives of this course are to (1) acquire knowledge of entrepreneurial finance, (2) to develop abilities to identify, analyze, and solve financial problems for new ventures or small and young companies, and (3) to learn how to articulate and demonstrate the growth and value propositions of the start-up or young firm to outside investors.","abbr":"MGO","subject":"Management Operations Analysis","num":"363LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0377","academic_org":"0382","long_title":"Finance for Entrepreneurs","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"MGO365":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a49c7904001eb70e98","regnum":"17116","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"MGO","num":"365SEM","title":"Tech Entrep","section":"S1O","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Neubert,Robert Alan","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Nsc 210","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1700},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1820},"when":[{"_id":"618652cf9c7904001eb7429a","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1700,"end":1820},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":96,"section":40,"enrolled":8,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660506a56f200297ac12f","course_id":"300950","title":"Tech Entrep","description":"The course will walk you through the process of starting a new technology-based venture from idea generation to commercialization.

Such strategies cannot focus only on the individual organization, but should encompass suppliers, supply networks, inbound logistics, distribution systems involving outbound logistics activities of warehousing and transportation, in addition to reverse logistics operations such as collection and recovery operations, third party service providers and consumers.  In this course, we will focus on the environmental impact of business operations, by taking a cradle-to-cradle approach that includes raw material acquisition through manufacturing, use, end-of-life disposal (reuse/recycling/remanufacturing). The topics covered include tools and techniques needed to quantify environmental impact in supply chains such as life cycle assessment and carbon footprinting, environmental legislation, design for the environment, recycling and remanufacturing, energy efficiency, eco-certification, responsible sourcing, and managing supply of renewable resources. The formulation of business and supply chain strategies that lead to actionable, proactive agenda for sustainability that not only ensures profitability for the firm but also social and environmental responsibility will be the central theme of this course.
