sites), and then reflect upon those experiences through assignments as detailed in the corresponding syllabus. To secure these learning opportunities, students apply to appropriate postings vetted by the Internships and Experiential Learning (IEL) team, in an on-line database, and are eligible to be selected by employers for interviews. Students are also allowed to locate internships outside of this database and report them to the IEL team for review and approval. Each employer site assigns a specific project to the student to be completed within the 150 hours during the course of a semester. Students participate in these opportunities under the supervision and mentorship of an on-site professional with expertise related to the curriculum, and receive exposure to and practice in day-to-day operations. In this specific course, these opportunities are based in the area of Data Analytics.","abbr":"MGQ","subject":"Management Quantitative Method","num":"496TUT","type_pk":"TUT","type":"Tutorial","grading_description":"Pass/Not Pass (PNP)","grading":"PNP","academic_group":"0377","academic_org":"0382","long_title":"Data Analytics Internship","min_credits":"1","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}}}
