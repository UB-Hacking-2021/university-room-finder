A game, in mathematical terms, consists of a starting point and various choices made by 'players.' Each choice might lead to new choices or to an outcome that ends the game. Some choices might be random; some might be made without full information about what has transpired. The players are each trying to maximize their own payoff, but the play of each might influence the results of the others.

Covers differentiation and integration with applications.  This course is a controlled enrollment (impacted) course. Students who have previously attempted the course and received a grade other than W may repeat the course in the summer or winter; or only in the fall or spring semester with a petition to the College of Arts and Sciences Deans' Office.

First-order and higher-order ordinary differential equations, including nonlinear equations. Covers analytic, geometric, and numerical perspectives as well as an interplay between methods and model problems. Discusses necessary matrix theory and explores differential equation models of phenomena from various disciplines.
