Whatever the answer may be, many of our most celebrated composers and songwriters also use their talents to earn a living. To discover how the basic principles of capitalism can influence both the creation and reception of music across a variety of genres, Music and Money takes an objective look at the historical circumstances that have shaped the development of the modern musical marketplace. Through a series of case studies, students will first evaluate the kinds of economic decisions faced not only by composers but also by performers, publishers, and audiences. Students will then explore the professional and artistic consequences of such decisions for musicians and for the music that they produce.","abbr":"MUS","subject":"Music","num":"204LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0208","long_title":"Music and Money","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASP","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"MUS236":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS328":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS288":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS192":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS283":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS285":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS240":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS274":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS276":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS284":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS278":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS297":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS280":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS484":{"_id":"618652a59c7904001eb711d5","regnum":"18061","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"MUS","num":"484STU","title":"Oboe","section":"KYL","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Kyle,Megan E","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Baird Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652b19c7904001eb728de","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"2","catalog":{"_id":"618660516a56f200297ac40c","course_id":"011537","title":"Oboe","description":"Private oboe study.

We will be seeking to use the skills acquired in Part I of the Survey into the investigation of Western music from the middle of the eighteenth-century through to the early 1960s. The course will develop students' abilities to apply historical, critical, and political concepts to the specific analytic details of both musical scores and musical sound. And thus, on the pragmatic level, the course will aim to develop studentsÂ¿ skills at reading musical scores analytically, listening to music within an historically informed framework, being able broadly to recognize the different stylistic periods, and (by means of the examinations) to develop a basic toolbox of important musical terms and to develop a memory and repertoire of different musics (through score identification). We will also continue developing the practice of reading scholarly texts, already begun in MUS 213, with the four substantial readings that have been assigned for the course of the semester.  Whilst the reportorial focus of our investigations will be the works of the Western art music cannon, the larger (and more important) aims of the course will, nevertheless, be to understand that the conflicts, difficulties, and uncertainties that we face today as humans in an increasingly vexed global context are part of a long-term and ongoing debate about what the human is, what its rights should be, and how its creative, artistic and musical endeavors should relate to the social and political structures that come into being as a result. This ongoing discourse we can call, for want of a better term, modernity, and its roots lie, to a large degree, in the philosophical ideas and political and social practices that started to come into being at the point at which Part II of the survey begins: in other words, the beginning of the eighteenth century.","abbr":"MUS","subject":"Music","num":"214LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0208","long_title":"Music History Survey 2","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"MUS188":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS235":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS174":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS194":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS200":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS184":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS180":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS435":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS190":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"MUS181":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb723b8","regnum":"24079","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"MUS","num":"181STU","title":"Flute","section":"KIM","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Kim,Sophia Gibbs","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Baird 316","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652db9c7904001eb74c41","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TBD"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":1,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660516a56f200297ac3c7","course_id":"015877","title":"Flute","description":"Private flute study.

This course investigates the economic, artistic, and cultural consequences of music printing from its invention in the late fifteenth century through its eventual decline in the twentieth. We first examine the practices through which publishers were able to cultivate an increasingly broad customer base in genres such as the madrigal and the piano duet. Next, we consider how the relationships between composers and publishersÂ¿and, by extension, their customersÂ¿were inevitably artistic as well as commercial. Although the publishing industry would eventually help to amplify the music of marginalized communities, we also question why some composers and songwriters were able to dominate the marketplace while others were routinely excluded. Finally, we explore how music printing has changed our cultural understanding of music itself through ideas about authenticity, performance practice, and artistic intent."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660516a56f200297ac3f4","course_id":"016535","title":"Special Topics in Music","description":"Studies special topics in music history, form or genre; lectures and listening assignments.
