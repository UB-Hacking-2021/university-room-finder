Emphasis is placed on the pathology, etiology, symptomatology, prognosis, and contraindications of musculoskeletal, sensory (vision and hearing), developmental, sensory processing, and other selected medical conditions across the lifespan. The ways in which these diseases and disabilities can affect the development, functioning, and occupation of individuals within their various contexts will be reviewed and examined. Implications for occupational therapy interventions and precautions for practice will be addressed.","abbr":"OT","subject":"Occupational Therapy","num":"356LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0448","academic_org":"1080","long_title":"Medical Conditions II","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: OT 355 and 366.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"OT 355 and 366","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"OT347":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT340":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT350":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT357":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT355":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT349":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT338":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT342":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT343":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT346":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT337":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT348":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT332":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT344":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT345":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT339":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT320":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT327":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT325":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT352":{"_id":"618652a49c7904001eb70fe3","regnum":"17499","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"OT","num":"352LEC","title":"Assistive Technology","section":"000","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Lenker,James A.","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"South Campus","campus":"South Campus","online":false,"room":"Dfn 02","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":930},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1045},"when":[{"_id":"618652bc9c7904001eb731c3","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":930,"end":1045},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":110,"section":48,"enrolled":17,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660546a56f200297ac6f1","course_id":"002666","title":"Assistive Technology","description":"Focuses on assistive technology and environmental adaptations to meet individual occupational performance needs.","abbr":"OT","subject":"Occupational Therapy","num":"352LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0448","academic_org":"1080","long_title":"Assistive Technology","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: OT 366 and ANA 407.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"OT 366 and ANA 407","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"OT331":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT326":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT336":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT328":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT341":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT329":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT333":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT324":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT330":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT323":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"OT321":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]}}
