Using a population perspective, we will examine the historical experience of the theory and practice of public health and consider the role of the field in addressing present-day issues and problems facing the nation and the globe.","abbr":"PUB","subject":"Public Health","num":"102LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0448","academic_org":"0448","long_title":"Historical and Contemporary Public Health Problems","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"PUB140":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB136":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB124":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB137":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB131":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB134":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB111":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB123":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB127":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB133":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB129":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB108":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB104":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB105":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB113":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB120":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB103":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB130":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB106":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB128":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB132":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB112":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB185":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB110":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB118":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB122":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB121":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB125":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB107":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB126":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB464":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB116":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB117":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB109":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB119":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB115":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB114":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB164":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB362":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PUB101":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a69c7904001eb714cd","regnum":"18959","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PUB","num":"101LEC","title":"Introduction to Public Health","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Bartelt,Elizabeth","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Norton 112","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":930},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1050},"when":[{"_id":"618652bf9c7904001eb734c3","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":930,"end":1050},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":335,"section":300,"enrolled":12,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660576a56f200297acc7b","course_id":"301638","title":"Introduction to Public Health","description":"Public health seeks to understand and improve the health and wellbeing of both individual people and of populations (groups of people).

We will explore the social patterning of health, longevity, and disease in the US today. Who avoids illness and who does not? Who is at increased risk of dying prematurely? We will then turn to understanding the social factors that shape health. How does the context of a person's life (where they live, who they are friends with, if they are married, if they work, their gender and sexual orientation) shape health? Finally, we will examine the role of medical care in contributing to health in the US. What is good health care, who gets it, and why?
