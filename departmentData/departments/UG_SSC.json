Funders, policymakers, and government officials also rely on program evaluations to help determine whether their resources are being utilized appropriately, and which programs they should continue to support. This course provides students with an overview of the frameworks, tools, and methodologies used to perform a program evaluation. Students will have an opportunity to practice some of the skills involved in evaluation, and to work together with classmates to create a sample program evaluation.","abbr":"SSC","subject":"Interdisciplinary Social Sci","num":"451SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0344","long_title":"Program Evaluation","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"SSC454":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC457":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC453":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC455":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC439":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC367":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC359":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC368":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC448":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SSC363":{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb70439","regnum":"13788","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"SSC","num":"363LEC","title":"The Aging Process","section":"HAR","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Harvey,Kelsey Amanda","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652d29c7904001eb7452c","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ASYN"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":40,"enrolled":19,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660596a56f200297acefd","course_id":"001109","title":"The Aging Process","description":"Introduces the aging process.
