Of course, it's impossible to cover all of the significant works, movements, and innovations in global theater in one semester. The material presented here can only be an incomplete history - an outline to be fleshed out later as your knowledge of the subject grows. Nevertheless, this course will provide a sturdy foundation for future investigation, and a set of analytical tools to help you approach unfamiliar theatrical forms or reappraise familiar ones. Theater has always been a place to think: about politics, about religion, about social life, about cultural inheritances or projected futures, about the theater itself. We'll weigh the arguments of theaters passionate advocates and its fiercest enemies; discuss its complex exchanges with other art forms; and consider its avid incorporation of new technologies.","abbr":"TH","subject":"Theatre","num":"301LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0224","long_title":"World Theatre Before 1700","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FA","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"TH446":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH455":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH465":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH444":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH439":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb705a7","regnum":"14244","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"TH","num":"439SR","title":"Studies in Design","section":"DB","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Burlingame,Dyan L","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Alumni 195","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1100},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1220},"when":[{"_id":"618652df9c7904001eb74f89","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1100,"end":1220},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":15,"section":15,"enrolled":4,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f19c7904001eb75e6e","sequence":1,"note":"PERMISSION OF INSTRUCTOR "}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186605a6a56f200297ad0be","course_id":"017034","title":"Studies in Design","description":"Development a hard copy and digital portfolio of work as associated with departmental design and technology assignments.

While it operates as a stand-alone course, it picks up where TH 301 (a survey from antiquity to the eighteenth century) concluded. During this time, the modern world as we know it came into being, accompanied by social and political revolutions that shook the foundations of public and private life. We'll watch theater artists around the world contend with the dominant philosophical ideas, aesthetic values, and socio-political realities of their time, as they attempt to create artworks capable of responding to - or even creating - a modern world. In doing so, they began to alter the molecular structure of theater, pulling apart traditional modes of understanding narrative, illusion, and character - destroying the old, to make way for the new.","abbr":"TH","subject":"Theatre","num":"302LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0224","long_title":"Theatre in the Modern World, 1700-Present","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"TH295":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH299":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH307":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH311":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH248":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH319":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH300":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH259":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH287":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH288":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH303":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb724ae","regnum":"24351","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"TH","num":"303LEC","title":"Scene Design 1","section":"LK","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Koscielniak,Lynne M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Alumni 195","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1100},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1220},"when":[{"_id":"618652e89c7904001eb75796","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1100,"end":1220},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MW"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":15,"section":30,"enrolled":2,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186605a6a56f200297ad098","course_id":"015006","title":"Scene Design 1","description":"Analysis, research, style as translation from text to image; visual communication through spacial arrangement as it applies to theatre.

We will explore techniques designed to both keep actors safe, and create a convincing illusion of violence onstage. As we go along, we will develop strength, flexibility, hand/eye coordination, athleticism, and an eye for dramaturgy as it pertains to staged violence. Students will also develop partnering skills, spatial awareness, and increase their comprehension of character development. While performance experience is not a requirement for this class, students are expected to understand the fundamentals of acting, including character and script analysis, basic stagecraft, and rehearsal technique. It is recommended, but not required, that students have prior performance/character analysis experience such as might be gained in TH108.","abbr":"TH","subject":"Theatre","num":"240SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0224","long_title":"Introduction to Stage Combat","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FA","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"TH437":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH235":{"_id":"618652ab9c7904001eb7209c","regnum":"23083","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"Non Standard","session_id":"NON","abbr":"TH","num":"235LAB","title":"Production Practicum","section":"ML","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Lamoreux,Melinda Jane","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Cfa Arr","start":{"date":"2022-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652ba9c7904001eb7304b","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186605a6a56f200297ad092","course_id":"015001","title":"Production Practicum","description":"Practical run crew experience on productions.","abbr":"TH","subject":"Theatre","num":"235LAB","type_pk":"LAB","type":"Laboratory","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0224","long_title":"Production Practicum","min_credits":"1","max_credits":"2","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: TH 135 Or TH 136.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"TH 135 Or TH 136","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FA","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"TH199":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb724ad","regnum":"24350","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"TH","num":"199SEM","title":"UB Seminar","section":"DB","section_status":"A","alt_title":"Live Event Production","instructor":"Burlingame,Dyan L","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Alumni 195","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1400},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1520},"when":[{"_id":"618652e89c7904001eb7579a","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1520},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":15,"section":15,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186605a6a56f200297ad085","course_id":"301382","title":"UB Seminar","description":"The three credit UB Seminar is focused on a big idea or challenging issue to engage students with questions of significance in a field of study and, ultimately, to connect their studies with issues of consequence in the wider world.
