However, where appropriate, decisions of the Executive branch made under various 'Executive Orders' are also considered.  Any understanding and appreciation of U.S. constitutional democracy requires us to acknowledge the powerful role of race in the evolution of this democracy.  Consequently regardless of the time period--the lives of all in the U.S. (of whatever color and sex) have been touched by the interaction between law and race.  In Part One of the course we concentrate on an area of legal studies called 'Critical Race Theory,' where our concern is to explore the interaction of law and race from the perspective of issues such as culture, history, gender, identity, politics, class, the media, etc.  In Part Two we examine the interaction between race and law from the perspective of the historical evolution of democracy in the U.S.   This course is the same as AMS 293, GGS 285 and HIS 304 and course repeat rules will apply.
