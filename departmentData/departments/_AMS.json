We will consider how such experiences continue to shape present thinking and future possibilities. This semester we will center these questions in an examination of perceptions of nature and culture in America. Together, we will navigate the stories of the 多American多 land by considering and analyzing the many ways in which landscape and identity converge and intersect. In this class, we will explore the intersection of environmental, social, historical, and cultural issues through an analysis of literary fiction, poetry, visual art, music, films, and other media. We will study how environmental issues are deeply connected to issues of race, socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity, disability, and the legacies of slavery and colonialism. Topics of the course may include but are not limited to: environmentalism(s); climate change; environmental justice; environmental racism; food justice; risk and sustainability; disaster and extinction; technology; conservation and preservation; extraction and energy; human and nonhuman relations; nostalgia and resilience; waste and toxicity; community expertise and traditional beliefs; environmental literature, cli-fi, and ecomedia; among various others."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186603f6a56f200297aa274","course_id":"008524","title":"Intro American Studies","description":"Introduces students to a variety of approaches that have been developed in American studies to assist understandings of how different people participate in this society and in the world.

However, where appropriate, decisions of the Executive branch made under various 'Executive Orders' are also considered.  Any understanding and appreciation of U.S. constitutional democracy requires us to acknowledge the powerful role of race in the evolution of this democracy.  Consequently regardless of the time period--the lives of all in the U.S. (of whatever color and sex) have been touched by the interaction between law and race.  In Part One of the course we concentrate on an area of legal studies called 'Critical Race Theory,' where our concern is to explore the interaction of law and race from the perspective of issues such as culture, history, gender, identity, politics, class, the media, etc.  In Part Two we examine the interaction between race and law from the perspective of the historical evolution of democracy in the U.S.   This course is the same as AAS 293, GGS 285 and HIS 304 and course repeat rules will apply.
