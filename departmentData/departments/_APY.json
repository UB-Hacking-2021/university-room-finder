This course provides an overview of the methods, theories and models used by archaeologists to better understand past human societies, from the formulation of a research question, through the processes of survey and excavation, to the analysis of data, and the interpretation of the results.

Who patronizes and works in these locations? How is culture performed in the resulting social spaces? This course examines sites of music making between 1920-1970, with a focus on intersections between race, place, and popular music in U.S. cities. Studies by cross-disciplinary scholars such George Lipsitz, bell hooks, and Henri Lefebvre will introduce critical frameworks for discussing and examining nightlife as contested social practices. For example, how was slumming in black and tan cabarets regulated and what does this say about racial politics, debates on morality, and the music industry of the Prohibition Era? Students will learn to engage with a variety of historical texts including commercial recordings, photo archives, oral histories, and contemporary newspapers in engaging with ethnographic narratives of clubs and other nightlife spaces. The course will draw from case studies that traverse jazz, blues, rock, and funk and be structured into 5 parts: 1920s and Prohibition, 1930s and Great Depression, 1940s and World War II, 1950s and Urban Redevelopment, 1960s and Civil Rights.\n\nThis course meets the Area Studies requirement.

This course examines the social and cultural dimensions of health, illness, and healing. Through a variety of case studies, we will learn about the ways medical anthropologists study explanations of disease, experiences of suffering, and the social organization of health care. Western medicine, also called biomedicine, will also be an object of our analysis. We will discuss how the delivery of biomedical health care involves particular understandings of the body and appropriate social relationships. Emphasis will also be placed on how the stories that individuals and institutions circulate about human agency in suffering shape individual convictions about how to care, and for whom to care. The course aims to teach students to think about health, disease, and medicine in national, cross-cultural and global terms.","abbr":"APY","subject":"Anthropology","num":"275LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded

Evolution","description":"Humans pass on and receive information, consciously and unconsciously, via social interactions. Some of this information manifests itself in the form of cultural traditions; for example, artifacts spread over time and space or the languages we speak. Using a framework of social transmission theory, many anthropologists have increasingly turned to evolutionary theory and methodology to study cultural traditions in material artifacts, language, or other products of cultural transmission processes. This course enables students to explore the main theoretical and methodological aspects of using social transmission theory and cultural evolutionary principles to address human behavioral patterns. A large part of the class deals with evolutionary theory, and allows students to better understand evolutionary theory and its application. Case studies will be presented, which will highlight the broad range of data to which such approaches may be applied. We will consider a range of case studies from a diversity of chronological periods and geographic settings (including contemporary settings). You will also critically consider the concept of ¿culture,¿ its presence (or otherwise) in animals other than humans, and what this may mean for the study of cultural phenomena. Students will come to see how contemporary applications of this approach differ from previous (and often theoretically erroneous) applications of evolutionary principles to the study of human behavior, which negatively taint evolutionary approaches to humanity to this day. The course will also help to dispel common misconceptions regarding the use of evolutionary theory to study culture, but be sensitively astute as to the reasons why these issues arise. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of both the theoretical and practical (methodological) tools involved in this type of work, and be able to conceive of how to apply them across various aspects of anthropological research.","abbr":"APY","subject":"Anthropology","num":"356SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded

The care of artifacts cannot stop at identification, physical conservation and exhibition. Research about museum and collection objects must be seen as part of a larger task: an exploration of the social and cultural significance of objects in relation to each other and to the people who made, used, and kept them as well as who collected them. Conservation must include preservation of the information accompanying an object, information beyond provenance, or artifact type. Finally, curatorial research entails a critical awareness of our own culturally-bound responses to artifacts. This course prepares students for research in the museum environment, and for the challenge of developing meaning and value for those collections in the context of the Cravens Collection housed since March 2010 in the Anderson Gallery of the UB College of Arts and Sciences where the course will be held. Each class integrates presentations, group work and discussion, case studies, and independent research. In addition, the instructor will facilitate visits from guest lecturers. At the end of the course, the students will curate together their own public exhibition of objects from the Cravens Collection and will write up short narratives about the objects they have studied during the course. The narratives  will then be included in an exhibition catalogue.    N.B.: Please note that the course will take place in the Anderson Gallery of the UB College of Arts and Sciences (1 Martha Jackson Place).","abbr":"APY","subject":"Anthropology","num":"414SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0346","long_title":"Museum Management","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"APY419":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY407":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY420":{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb7224a","regnum":"23647","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"APY","num":"420SEM","title":"Topics","section":"GON","section_status":"A","alt_title":"Museum Ethnology","instructor":"Gonzalez,Edith Marie","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Clemen 21","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1230},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1350},"when":[{"_id":"618652e79c7904001eb756d0","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1230,"end":1350},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":27,"section":25,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652ec9c7904001eb75999","sequence":1,"note":"This course looks at anthropology museums and the history of ethnographic collecting by museums in the 19th-century as a way into an understanding of the history of the field of Anthropology itself.

The overall aims of this course are to a. engage with material that directs our attention to the precarity of masculinity i.e. how masculinity is not fixed in its definitions or practices; b. highlight how masculinities derive meaning in relation to (other masculinities/women); and c. how structures (policies, law, representations in scientific literature, medicine and technology) play a key role in reproducing as well as changing and shifting dominant notions of masculinities.\n\nThis course meets the Senior Seminar requirement.
