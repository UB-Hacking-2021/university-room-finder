The care of artifacts cannot stop at identification, physical conservation and exhibition. Research about museum and collection objects must be seen as part of a larger task: an exploration of the social and cultural significance of objects in relation to each other and to the people who made, used, and kept them as well as who collected them. Conservation must include preservation of the information accompanying an object, information beyond provenance, or artifact type. Finally, curatorial research entails a critical awareness of our own culturally-bound responses to artifacts. This course prepares students for research in the museum environment, and for the challenge of developing meaning and value for those collections in the context of the Cravens Collection housed since March 2010 in the Anderson Gallery of the UB College of Arts and Sciences where the course will be held. Each class integrates presentations, group work and discussion, case studies, and independent research. In addition, the instructor will facilitate visits from guest lecturers. At the end of the course, the students will curate together their own public exhibition of objects from the Cravens Collection and will write up short narratives about the objects they have studied during the course. The narratives  will then be included in an exhibition catalogue.    N.B.: Please note that the course will take place in the Anderson Gallery of the UB College of Arts and Sciences (1 Martha Jackson Place).","abbr":"APY","subject":"Anthropology","num":"514SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0346","long_title":"Museum Management","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"APY533":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY529":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY524":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY507":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY511":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY532":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY531":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY504":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY562":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY510":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY520":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY505":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY528":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY521":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY503":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY508":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71db7","regnum":"21852","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"APY","num":"508SEM","title":"Qual Research Methods","section":"JOS","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Joshi,Meghana Arun","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Ellicott Complex","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Academ 261","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":930},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1210},"when":[{"_id":"618652c29c7904001eb737ad","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":930,"end":1210},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":36,"section":10,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa363","course_id":"003556","title":"Qual Research Methods","description":"This course introduces graduate students to research design, field methods, data analysis, ethnographic writing, proposal writing, and ethical review procedures.","abbr":"APY","subject":"Anthropology","num":"508SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0346","long_title":"Qualitative Research Methods","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"APY639":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY638":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY641":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY551":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY567":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY565":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY656":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY660":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY558":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY560":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY662":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"APY561":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71e04","regnum":"22014","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"APY","num":"561LEC","title":"Human Paleontology","section":"HOL","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Holowka,Nicholas Baird","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Ellicott Complex","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Spaulding 158","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1530},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1810},"when":[{"_id":"618652d69c7904001eb747f1","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1530,"end":1810},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":24,"section":10,"enrolled":3,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f09c7904001eb75dbb","sequence":1,"note":"This course provides an in depth survey of the human fossil record, including the anatomy and behavior of the many fascinating ancient human species that have walked the earth since our last common ancestor with chimpanzees.

Here, we will explore the history of 'racial anthropology' and its impact on the modem discipline of biological anthropology. Biological anthropologists today use a variety of analytical models and techniques drawn from population and quantitative genetics in order to analyze human biological diversity in a meaningful way. Students will be introduced to these such that the complexities of microevolutionary theory are readily understood through a series of modem human case-studies. Students will investigate the extent to which humans have adapted to various environmental conditions as well as understanding the effects of recent migrations, demographic changes and population expansions. This facilitates a direct comparison with other non-evolutionary methods of analysis such as those employed by forensic anthropologists. Finally, we will investigate the potential for using models of human diversity to understand the evolution of other human paleospecies.
