One of hypotheses that the class addresses is this: Is denser the city, the greener it is or is it? Through the use of provocative readings and comparative analysis and mapping techniques, we compare major cities around the world to understand the relation between urban density and urbanism, its economic and environmental robustness: placemaking, good urban form and great streets -- all contributing to making cities great and robust ecologically, economically and

Analyzes and examine how design criteria vary with factors like geography, climate, and construction type to develop evaluative measures. Using modeling or digital forensics tools, develop hypotheses based on these conditions to evaluate potential solutions for systems like active and passive heating and cooling, solar geometry, daylighting, natural ventilation, indoor air quality, solar systems, lighting, and/or acoustics. Upon conclusion of the course, students develop convincing representations of systems function to demonstrate how their decisions could be integrated with other building systems, including structural and thermal envelopes. Considers impacts on environmental building systems design, including form, structure, and material. Involves lecture, discussions, and fieldwork.","abbr":"ARC","subject":"Architecture","num":"575LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0226","academic_org":"0227","long_title":"Environmental Systems 3","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"ARC643":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]}}
