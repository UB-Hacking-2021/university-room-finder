The emerging movement had the most trackable activity occurring within the UK, US and parts of Northern Europe. The movement initially focused on the rejection of the rampant commercialization of the art making process and its products.  Land artist sought ways to create outside of urban centers. They embraced the use of materials found in nature such as rocks and grasses and soils and vegetation as well as, elusive natural phenomena and processes.  Photo documentation became a primary method for the chronicling and dissemination of works produced in remote non-urban settings. Along with the resistance to commercialization the movement also converged with the rise of the environmental movement and coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living which came to be know as the Back to the Land movement and the romanticization of all things rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet Earth as home to humanity. Land art was part of the wider conceptual art movement within the same era. \n\nIn this course we will discuss the land art works of Robert Smithson and his iconic work, Spiral Jetty of 1970, built out into the Great Salt Lake in the USA. Some of the other artists such as the Brit, Richard Long, made minimal and temporary interventions in the landscape such as simply walking to make a mark in the earth. We will look at artists such as Nancy Holt, Michael Heizer, Andy Goldsworthy, Dennis Oppenheim, Nils Udo, Hamish Fulton, Anna Mendieta and more.\n\nThe course will also have students realize outdoor interventions and design proposals for outdoor projects."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa566","course_id":"007644","title":"Special Topics Studio","description":"Studio based graduate course with rotating subjects that is repeatable for credit.

We will begin with an overview of computational thinking and the expanding list of areas it applies itself to. Thereafter we will survey several currently used A.I methodologies (optimization, classification and generative systems) and use case studies to understand how they are applied to specific design problems in specific contexts. From these case studies we will attempt to understand how designers use computational thinking to make specific computational methods effective. The course will also survey critical views on A.I. practices and illustrate some of the traps machine learning systems create for the public and designers working with them.","abbr":"ART","subject":"Art","num":"543STU","type_pk":"STU","type":"Studio","grading_description":"Graded

Through audio recording and editing, students will study and produce environmentally sensitive sound works for creative inquiry. Sound and Field will introduce writings by and about an array of figures using field recording and found sound as research and as raw material to incorporate into artworks. The course will emphasize the importance of careful listening. Students will make field recordings, work with audio editing software, present projects informed by course readings and discussion, and write one midterm and one final paper to be presented in support of projects. Participants will develop field recording strategies, audio editing technique, and construct projects as a basis for giving voice to our local environments.\n\nOrienting our critical inquiry and active investigation in acoustic ecology research we will engage uses of sound as an artistic medium. Students will record, construct and engage with sound environments beginning with sound walks and field recordings, towards developing techniques and ideas for mid-term and final projects. This course will include readings, discussion, listening sessions, guest presentations and independent projects. There will be an emphasis on site-specific projects. Historic and contemporary sound artworks and archives will be presented and discussed, and we will work both in the studio and in the field to consider the soundscapes and aural architectures of our surrounding environments. Students will be introduced to recording and audio editing as entry points to working with found sounds.\n\nWe will examine the relationships between location, environment, sound, silence and noise, and test these ideas through research as well as hands-on sound art projects."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa56f","course_id":"017309","title":"Special Topics","description":null,"abbr":"ART","subject":"Art","num":"575SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"1379","long_title":"Special Topics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"ART583":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ART585":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ART570":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ART578":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ART573":{"_id":"618652a39c7904001eb70d46","regnum":"16724","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ART","num":"573LAB","title":"Performative Action","section":"MC","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Chen,Millie","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"CFA B13","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1530},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2030},"when":[{"_id":"618652b19c7904001eb7290b","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1530,"end":2030},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":8,"section":10,"enrolled":2,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f89c7904001eb763ef","sequence":1,"note":"Graduate and advanced undergraduate course on the practice and theories of performance and performativity in contemporary art.
