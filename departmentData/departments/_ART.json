This course develops the designer's capacity for graphic thought through semantic and syntactic explorations of visual culture, semiotics and representation. Through a variety of studio exercises and one semester-long assignment, students develop their own design processes to discover the ways in which graphic design engages in visual knowledge production. Students will cultivate a conceptual aptitude and an understanding of methods, principles, conventions, and experimental processes using various digital platforms to create print and digital media as a communicative and intellectual practice.","abbr":"ART","subject":"Art","num":"309LAB","type_pk":"LAB","type":"Laboratory","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"1379","long_title":"Meaning, Representation and Culture","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: ART 321.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"ART 321","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"Art442":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art361":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art334":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art365":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art333":{"_id":"618652a49c7904001eb70f9a","regnum":"17412","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ART","num":"333LAB","title":"3d Precision Prod Concpts","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Siano,Christopher M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"CFA B24","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1130},"when":[{"_id":"618652b99c7904001eb72f35","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":900,"end":1130},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"},{"_id":"618652e99c7904001eb75854","sequence":2,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":15,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa525","course_id":"016606","title":"3d Precision Prod Concpts","description":"ART 333 is a technical elective teaching 3d modeling and techniques in digital and analog fabrication.

Sound and Field will introduce writings by and about an array of figures using field recording and found sound as research and as raw material to incorporate into artworks. The course will emphasize the importance of careful listening. Students will make field recordings, work with audio editing software, present projects informed by course readings and discussion, and write one midterm and one final paper to be presented in support of projects. Participants will develop field recording strategies, audio editing technique, and construct projects as a basis for giving voice to our local environments.\n\nOrienting our critical inquiry and active investigation in acoustic ecology research we will engage uses of sound as an artistic medium. Students will record, construct and engage with sound environments beginning with sound walks and field recordings, towards developing techniques and ideas for mid-term and final projects. This course will include readings, discussion, listening sessions, guest presentations and independent projects. There will be an emphasis on site-specific projects. Historic and contemporary sound artworks and archives will be presented and discussed, and we will work both in the studio and in the field to consider the soundscapes and aural architectures of our surrounding environments. Students will be introduced to recording and audio editing as entry points to working with found sounds.\n\nWe will examine the relationships between location, environment, sound, silence and noise, and test these ideas through research as well as hands-on sound art projects."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa548","course_id":"018747","title":"Special Topics","description":null,"abbr":"ART","subject":"Art","num":"475SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"1379","long_title":"Special Topics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"OC","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"Art477":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art456":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art283":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art354":{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb7226f","regnum":"23690","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ART","num":"354LAB","title":"Studio Photography","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Opera,John M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"CFA 118","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1130},"when":[{"_id":"618652eb9c7904001eb75931","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":900,"end":1130},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":20,"section":12,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa52a","course_id":"016878","title":"Studio Photography","description":"Examines photographic studio lighting and location shooting.

The emerging movement had the most trackable activity occurring within the UK, US and parts of Northern Europe. The movement initially focused on the rejection of the rampant commercialization of the art making process and its products.  Land artist sought ways to create outside of urban centers. They embraced the use of materials found in nature such as rocks and grasses and soils and vegetation as well as, elusive natural phenomena and processes.  Photo documentation became a primary method for the chronicling and dissemination of works produced in remote non-urban settings. Along with the resistance to commercialization the movement also converged with the rise of the environmental movement and coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living which came to be know as the Back to the Land movement and the romanticization of all things rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet Earth as home to humanity. Land art was part of the wider conceptual art movement within the same era. \n\nIn this course we will discuss the land art works of Robert Smithson and his iconic work, Spiral Jetty of 1970, built out into the Great Salt Lake in the USA. Some of the other artists such as the Brit, Richard Long, made minimal and temporary interventions in the landscape such as simply walking to make a mark in the earth. We will look at artists such as Nancy Holt, Michael Heizer, Andy Goldsworthy, Dennis Oppenheim, Nils Udo, Hamish Fulton, Anna Mendieta and more.\n\nThe course will also have students realize outdoor interventions and design proposals for outdoor projects."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa538","course_id":"005320","title":"Spec Top in Vis Studies","description":"Topics vary by semester.","abbr":"ART","subject":"Art","num":"415LAB","type_pk":"LAB","type":"Laboratory","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"1379","long_title":"Special Topics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASP","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}}]},"Art410":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art405":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art406":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art402":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art400":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art397":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art395":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art409":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art396":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art394":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art399":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art390":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art393":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art391":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art401":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art392":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art388":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art387":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art385":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art389":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art386":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art383":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art379":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art382":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art378":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"Art381":{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb72270","regnum":"23692","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ART","num":"381LAB","title":"Motion Graphics","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Kenyon,Matthew","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"CFA 136","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1230},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1500},"when":[{"_id":"618652b69c7904001eb72cc0","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1230,"end":1500},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MW"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":25,"section":15,"enrolled":5,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660406a56f200297aa530","course_id":"016895","title":"Motion Graphics","description":"Explores with computer graphics, the expressive and informative impact of real time and frame/cell animation: pixilation;
