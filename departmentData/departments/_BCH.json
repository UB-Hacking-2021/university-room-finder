analysis of large scale DNA and protein datasets, statistical analysis of sequence alignments and microarray and next-generation sequencing datasets, and proteomics. This 3 credit course will be taught in the computer lab and will feature a mix of didactic and hands-on instruction. Typically, the Tuesday session will be a didactic lecture introducing the topic of the week and giving out assignments for completion at or prior to the Thursday lab session. The Thursday lab will focus on practical use of the concepts taught in the Tuesday lecture. Laboratory sessions will sometimes include programming assignments in the Python computer language.","abbr":"BCH","subject":"Biochemistry","num":"419LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0456","academic_org":"0462","long_title":"Introduction to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisites: CSE 116 and (BIO 319 or BCH 310) or permission of instructor.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"CSE 116 and (BIO 319 or BCH 310) or permission of instructor","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"BCH394":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH418":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH395":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH396":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH387":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH411":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH403":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH392":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH409":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH397":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH406":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH413":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH390":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"BCH408":{"_id":"6186529d9c7904001eb6fcd6","regnum":"11613","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"BCH","num":"408SEM","title":"Gene Expression","section":"PAR","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Park,Yungki","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1300},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1450},"when":[{"_id":"618652d69c7904001eb7486d","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1300,"end":1450},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":10,"enrolled":8,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660416a56f200297aa5cd","course_id":"018106","title":"Gene Expression","description":"Elective course that familiarizes students with up-to-date concepts in eukaryotic gene expression.
