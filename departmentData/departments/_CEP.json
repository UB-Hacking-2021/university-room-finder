The course explores both theories and processes of supervision and the application of those theories and processes. Students are responsible for reading and discussing assigned articles and for presenting cases emanating from their supervision of master's-level students. Each member of the seminar is assigned to supervise three supervisees who are counseling in either schools or rehabilitation agencies.

Collaboration across disciplines can result in effective and resilient prevention and intervention programs that benefit students, clients, organizations, and communities. Psychologists and educators can consult on the design, implementation, and evaluation of programs at the individual, systemic, or ecological levels in contemporary settings such as schools, community, organizations, and hospitals. The potential for the preventive infusion of wellness, interpersonal problem solving skill, and effective educational practices through consultation is of particular interest. This course examines the theory and practice of psychological and educational consultation with individuals and organizations. Fundamental skills of consultation are reviewed and inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches and term-based practices are stressed to prepare professionals for consultation in emerging organizational paradigms.

With a focus on the effective application of psychological concepts and principles in the learning and instructional process, students will develop an understanding of the foundational and contemporary principles that define this field and explore the research in this area.","abbr":"CEP","subject":"Counseling, School & Ed Psych","num":"560LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0660","long_title":"The Psychology of Learning and Instruction","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"CEP546":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP558":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP562":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP569":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP555":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP790":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP702":{"total":12,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652ab9c7904001eb72052","regnum":"22957","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CEP","num":"702TUT","title":"Indiv Guidnc Dissertation","section":"ALR","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Reynolds,Amy L","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Off Ca 00","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652b79c7904001eb72db6","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":10,"enrolled":2,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660436a56f200297aa91c","course_id":"014884","title":"Indiv Guidnc Dissertation","description":"Dissertation in major program; involves designing and conducting a data-based research project to be defended before a dissertation committee chaired by the student's advisor.

The coaching process encourages clients toward taking empowered action in the present moment, and does not focus on pathology, counseling, or the client's distant past. This course is designed to help counselors, lawyers, doctors and others in the helping professions assimilate the best practices of coaching toward personal growth for their clients, patients, as well as into their own lives. Students will learn, practice and discuss the coaching process, develop an empirically based understanding of the effectiveness of these techniques, as well as learn to implement coaching for wellness and physiological integration. Students will learn to guide their patients and clients toward addressing feelings, thoughts and beliefs so that they can take action. Coursework will be a combination of readings, discussions, research review, and partnered personal coaching toward wellness, and practices that result in physiological integration. Students will be expected to participate in discussions, successfully complete the structured unit assignments as well as to call in for a group and team coaching session once every other week.","abbr":"CEP","subject":"Counseling, School & Ed Psych","num":"548SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0660","long_title":"Coaching for Wellness & Physiological Integration","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"CEP554":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP786":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP795":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP789":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP787":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP779":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP544":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP551":{"_id":"618652a49c7904001eb70f0c","regnum":"17252","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CEP","num":"551SEM","title":"Sch-Wide Prac Diverse Lrnrs","section":"SP","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Nickerson,Amanda B","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Grein 116B","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1300},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1540},"when":[{"_id":"618652e29c7904001eb751df","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1300,"end":1540},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":24,"section":21,"enrolled":16,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660436a56f200297aa8d3","course_id":"001425","title":"Sch-Wide Prac Diverse Lrnrs","description":"This course covers diversity issues and school-wide practices for school psychologists in training.

It affects everyone and at times it affects everyone profoundly. We are born with innate ways of healing from the pain of loss, but our society extinguishes many of these coping mechanisms by adolescence. Unresolved grief is the major reason people seek counseling and a significant cause of health problems, yet it is often unrecognized as source of the problem. The purpose of this course is to discuss how you can respond in helpful and comforting ways to people who are grieving by understanding your own grief, the nature of grief and healing, and the things that seem to help people who are hurting. This course is more personal than academic, more practical than theoretical, yet focuses on the underlying scientific grieving principles to explain why some things help and other things don't. To help grieving people we need to learn a set of behaviors based on these principles. We also have to unlearn typical ways of responding to people who are hurting. The class is intended to be relatively informal and our time will be spent talking about grief, listening to some tapes, in discussion with questions and answers, and in personal discussion of some of our own experiences. We will focus on counseling grieving people, the aftermath of murder and suicide, crisis interventions in schools, suicide prevention, and the spiritual aspects of death and loss.","abbr":"CEP","subject":"Counseling, School & Ed Psych","num":"616LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0660","long_title":"Grief Counseling and Issues in Grief & Loss","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"CEP607":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP579":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP608":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CEP634":{"total":3,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a19c7904001eb707be","regnum":"14816","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CEP","num":"634LEC","title":"Multicultural Counseling","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Chong,Shiqin Stephanie","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Baldy 200G","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2140},"when":[{"_id":"618652c19c7904001eb736a4","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1900,"end":2140},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":48,"section":24,"enrolled":4,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652fb9c7904001eb767b5","sequence":1,"note":"PREREQ CEP 653           "}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660436a56f200297aa8fc","course_id":"014843","title":"Multicultural Counseling","description":"This course is designed to assist students in understanding and valuing diversity so they can become multiculturally competent and better able to work effectively with diverse clients and communities.
