The course emphasizes public health interventions and strategies to promote healthy behaviors and discourage unhealthy behaviors. The course examines consequences, patterns, risk factors, and change/interventions for each behavior or problem. Behaviors are examined from multiples perspectives (e.g., individual, social, environmental) and with a systems perspective in mind, illuminating the interconnecting influences on behaviors. Health behaviors and behavior change interventions are presented in the context of current research and theory. The course also examines the role of health disparities, public health policy, current debate, health behavior theory and emerging research.","abbr":"CHB","subject":"Community Hlth & Hlth Behavior","num":"502LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0448","academic_org":"0713","long_title":"Health Behavior Change","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"CHB500":{"total":4,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a99c7904001eb71be0","regnum":"21161","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CHB","num":"500LEC","title":"Special Topics","section":"COL","section_status":"A","alt_title":"Cannabis: A Review","instructor":"Collins,R Lorraine","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"South Campus","campus":"South Campus","online":false,"room":"Dfn 103","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1140},"when":[{"_id":"618652cc9c7904001eb74000","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":900,"end":1140},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":true,"saturday":false},"pattern":"F"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":48,"section":40,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660436a56f200297aa92f","course_id":"018007","title":"Special Topics","description":null,"abbr":"CHB","subject":"Community Hlth & Hlth Behavior","num":"500LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0456","academic_org":"0713","long_title":"Special Topics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71e48","regnum":"22142","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CHB","num":"500LEC","title":"Special Topics","section":"LEO","section_status":"A","alt_title":"Food Access Disparities","instructor":"Leone,Lucia Andrea","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1400},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1530},"when":[{"_id":"618652b59c7904001eb72c5c","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1530},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":true,"saturday":false},"pattern":"F"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":10,"enrolled":9,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[{"_id":"618652fc9c7904001eb769b8","sequence":1,"note":"Entrepreneurial Solutions for Addressing Food Access Disparities\n\nThis course will provide students with practical experience addressing food access disparities using principals of social entrepreneurship.
