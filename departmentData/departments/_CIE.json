The economics of sustainability is concerned with the question of whether the total economy and/or per capita human welfare can be sustained at current levels, or increased, in the future given that some resources are finite and that human activities are harming parts of the global ecosystem. Environmental economics is concerned with how economic analysis can be applied to promote the efficient use of natural resources; such as land, air, soil, fauna and flora.  Frequently, market failure, or the absence of markets, leads to the misuse of natural resources and environmental pollution. Environmental economics considers how economic reasoning can be applied to identify the causes of pollution and environmental degradation and to design policies to avoid, reduce or mitigate them."}],"association":"4","catalog":{"_id":"618660446a56f200297aaa58","course_id":"010066","title":"Special Topics","description":"CIE 500 presents advanced topics in civil engineering to meet the needs and interests of students.
