Codes are used ubiquitously in communication systems and data storage. The study of error correcting codes (or coding theory) started with the seminal works of Shannon and Hamming in the late 1940s and has been an active cross-disciplinary research area since then. This course will discuss the theoretical aspects of codes and will focus mostly on the worst-case noise model pioneered by Hamming. However, we will discuss quite a few results on the stochastic noise model pioneered by Shannon. The course will roughly cover three parts: (i) combinatorial aspects of codes, i.e. the limit of what can and cannot be achieved with codes; (ii) computationally efficient algorithms for using codes; and (ii) application of codes in theoretical computer science. Major developments in coding theory since the 1990s will be emphasized. This course is dual listed with CSE 445.","abbr":"CSE","subject":"Computer Science & Engineering","num":"545LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1079","long_title":"Coding Theory","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"CSE532":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE519":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE524":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE539":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE530":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE538":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE521":{"_id":"618652a49c7904001eb70dd5","regnum":"16887","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CSE","num":"521LEC","title":"Operating Systems","section":"000","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Ghanei,Farshad","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Knox 110","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1230},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1350},"when":[{"_id":"618652c89c7904001eb73c6b","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1230,"end":1350},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":222,"section":110,"enrolled":59,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660466a56f200297aad3f","course_id":"017778","title":"Operating Systems","description":"Concepts of operating systems described in terms of function, structure, and implementation; particular emphasis on multiprogramming.

We begin with an understanding of various kinds of robots and their kinematics. We then study the various sensors that can be used, and algorithms to perceive what the robot is doing (proprioception) as well as what is around it (exteroception). Most sensing and actuation is uncertain. We study Bayes filter as the framework for probabilistically reasoning about this uncertainty while being able to predict the robot state at any given instant. Specifically, we look at the problems of localization (where am i?) and mapping (what is around me?), the two fundamental problems in mobile robots. We then conclude the course by looking at planning and navigation algorithms to perform a given task along with robot control architectures to put all these together to achieve autonomy","abbr":"CSE","subject":"Computer Science & Engineering","num":"568LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1079","long_title":"Robotics Algorithms","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"CSE571":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE562":{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb70420","regnum":"13762","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CSE","num":"562LEC","title":"Database Systems","section":"000","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Zhao,Zhuoyue","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Knox 110","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1100},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1220},"when":[{"_id":"618652b89c7904001eb72e8c","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1100,"end":1220},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":222,"section":180,"enrolled":180,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660466a56f200297aad64","course_id":"005224","title":"Database Systems","description":"The basic design principles of systems managing very large databases will be discussed.

Throughout the semester, students work in small teams implementing either assigned or self-proposed projects focusing on a parallel architecture of their choice (e.g., GPGPU accelerators, shared-memory servers, distributed memory bare-metal or cloud-based clusters, etc.), and using their preferred programming model (e.g., CUDA, MPI, Spark, RPC-based APIs, etc.). The course puts equal emphasis on all aspects of the project execution, all the way from the conception and background research, through implement-test-benchmark loop, all the way to the end-product deployment and demonstration. The purely practical component of the course is complemented by milestone presentations and written reports by each team, and is culminated by the full-scale product presentation at the end of the semester.","abbr":"CSE","subject":"Computer Science & Engineering","num":"603LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1079","long_title":"Parallel and Distributed Processing","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"CSE639":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE638":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE604":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE654":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE640":{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb721f8","regnum":"23552","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CSE","num":"640LEC","title":"Graph Mining and Management","section":"SARI","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Sariyuce,Ahmet Erdem","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Nsc 216","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1330},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1450},"when":[{"_id":"618652d19c7904001eb74473","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1330,"end":1450},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MW"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":97,"section":96,"enrolled":12,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660466a56f200297aad92","course_id":"302715","title":"Graph Mining and Management","description":"This course introduces several important problems and algorithms being used in many applications where the input data is a graph.

Examples of CPS include but are not limited to smart appliances, smart grids, robots, and autonomous vehicles. A CPS is considered emerging if it recently started getting deployed in the real-world or is deemed promising for wide-scale deployment in the near future. The security issues surrounding such emerging systems, however, may prevent end-users from utilizing their full potential, or, even worse, may rule out the chances of their deployment in the future. Currently, these emerging systems are built based on technologies ranging from Internet of Things (IoT) and deep-learning systems to edge and 5G/Next-G systems. In this seminar course, we will discuss some of the latest work in the area of securing emerging CPS, including emerging network technologies and security (NFV, SDN, Edge, 5G/Next-G, etc.), IoT security and privacy (smart home, connected and autonomous vehicles, voice assistant platforms - Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, etc.), and machine learning for security and privacy (adversarial attacks and defenses on deep learning, backdoor attacks and defenses on deep learning, etc.).\n\nThe main goal of the special topic course is to help students understand the state of the art in a variety of security topics in emerging CPS. As a secondary goal, students will learn how to read research papers and how to communicate technical material effectively.\n\nThe special topic course is suitable for students who have a strong interest in network and system security and intent to pursue a career in the area, e.g., Ph.D. students already working in cybersecurity or MS students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. or doing research in the field (in the form of independent studies and/or MS Thesis). One of the goals of this seminar is to identify, by the end of the semester, a set of open research problems on which students can work during the next semester, e.g., in the form of independent studies."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660466a56f200297aad86","course_id":"301846","title":"Special Topics","description":null,"abbr":"CSE","subject":"Computer Science & Engineering","num":"610LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1079","long_title":"Special Topics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb72256","regnum":"23662","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CSE","num":"610LEC","title":"Special Topics","section":"NWOG","section_status":"A","alt_title":"Multimodal Affective Computing","instructor":"Nwogu,Ifeoma O","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Clemen 103","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1000},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1050},"when":[{"_id":"618652b69c7904001eb72d24","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1000,"end":1050},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":true,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MWF"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":44,"section":30,"enrolled":27,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652ed9c7904001eb75b90","sequence":1,"note":"This course explores affective computing techniques for analyzing human perception data such as faces, voice signals, galvanic skin response data and others.

We explore different types of dynamic perception data and use these as homework and project examples throughout the semester. The course work involves reviewing papers, team based projects and presentations. Students work with different signals and toolkits, and also develop their own models as needed.

Such algorithms have been effective at uncovering underlying structure in data, e.g., features to discriminate between classes. They have been successful in many artificial intelligence problems including image classification, speech recognition and natural language processing. The course, which will be taught through lectures and projects, will cover the underlying theory, the range of applications to which it has been applied, and learning from very large data sets. The course will cover connectionist architectures commonly associated with deep learning, e.g., basic neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.","abbr":"CSE","subject":"Computer Science & Engineering","num":"676LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"1079","long_title":"Deep Learning","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: CSE 474 or CSE 574.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"CSE 474 or CSE 574","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FA","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"CSE733":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE717":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE734":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE758":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE750":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE708":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE741":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"CSE712":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb7242b","regnum":"24200","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"CSE","num":"712SEM","title":"Seminars","section":"GAO","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Gao,Mingchen","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 209","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1400},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1640},"when":[{"_id":"618652d79c7904001eb74990","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1640},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":48,"section":30,"enrolled":30,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660466a56f200297aadc1","course_id":"002222","title":"Seminars","description":"This course is a seminar.
