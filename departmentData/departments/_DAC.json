It is grounded in the assumption that practice is research, and research is practice. With a firm foundation in dance making and dance studies, we will engage philosophical, cognitive scientific, feminist, queer, performance studies, and historical notions of embodiment in our discussion and engagement as researching bodies. Our investigations will include theories of embodiment and also those phenomena generally ascribed to ¿the body¿ such as emotions, the senses (particularly kinesthetic and touch), gender, and race. Students will explore and articulate the research practices inherent in their own creative inquiry, and how their body-based research intersects other disciplines. The course objectives are for students to be conversant in the interdisciplinary field of embodiment via several points of contact and to be able to place themselves as a researching/practicing body within these discourses.","abbr":"DAC","subject":"Dance","num":"582SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0224","long_title":"Creative Practice and Embodied Research","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"DAC559":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"DAC551":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"DAC555":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"DAC554":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"DAC568":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"DAC545":{"total":4,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a89c7904001eb719df","regnum":"20501","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"DAC","num":"545TUT","title":"Directed Projects","section":"AB","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Burnidge,Anne","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Cfa Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652c59c7904001eb739ba","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660466a56f200297aae3b","course_id":"007338","title":"Directed Projects","description":"This course provides the opportunity for mentored choreographic project work and includes both faculty and peer observation and critique.
