The bright pixels of digital video make for captivating imagery, but there¿s a unique beauty to the swirl of grain in analog film. If you want to experience the hands-on physicality of mechanical and chemical reproduction, if you want a deeper understanding of the origins of all the settings on your video camera, if you want to know what an actual frame, shutter, and aperture are, and if you want a change from this age of digital reproduction wherein every task means sitting at a monitor and clicking a mouse, 16mm Film Production may be for you. \n\nThe class will cover the basics of shooting 16mm film and delve into alternative methods of creating in the medium (hand-processing, camera-less film techniques, in-camera special effects, etc.). In-class workshops will be supplemented by take-home assignments and exercises. Although more of a materials and processes class, the semester will culminate in a group installation. Hands-on production will be supported with technical- and theory-based readings along with screenings of contemporary and historical work. Students will receive some assistance with supplies and film stock, but should expect to spend additionally on stock and processing.

As Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby explain, speculative design ¿contests `official reality¿; it is a form of dissent expressed through alternative design proposals. It aims to be inspirational, infectious, and catalytic, zooming out and stepping back to address values and ethics. It strives to overcome the invisible wall separating dreams and imagination from everyday life, blurring distinctions between the `real¿ real and the `unreal¿ real.¿  We will discuss the principles of speculative design, linking art and media with engineering, science, and politics.

Games are considered as a new art form and in order to create compelling games, students must be aware of the particularities of the form in both structural and aesthetic terms. Clearly the most important difference between games and other art forms are the interactive and interpersonal dynamics of gaming. However, game design draws on many other disciplines (writing, drawing, graphic design, architecture, and programming), and that familiarity with the assumptions and languages of these disciplines is essential for a game designer. Core issues of games design; What is a game? What is the nature of play? What makes good game play? What is the most effective use of sound and visuals in a game? How can narrative be used in games? And what are the roles of presence, engagement, and interactivity in games?  Encourages experimental thinking about the boundaries and possibilities of computer games. Students work in teams to produce a series of short games projects. Focuses on creativity and experimentation. Thorough, hands-on grounding in the process of game design. from conception to play-testing, and fosters the skills required to produce, examine, and critique games.

Addresses different theoretical perspectives that view games and gaming as historical, social, cultural. aesthetic, technical, performative, and cognitive phenomenon. Examines how video games encompass an increasingly diverse set of practices, populations, and locations from fantasy football to multi-player medieval fantasy, from simulations of real life to alternate realities, from fanatics to activists, from nightclubs to competitive arenas to public streets to the classroom; from consoles to mobile phones, to large screen projections. Analyses not only popular games but interactive installations, pervasive games, mixed and virtual reality environments. Discusses the interdisciplinary nature of a cultural practice which depends on art, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, etc.","abbr":"DMS","subject":"Media
