Each student will be allowed to keep their own customized hammer as a souvenir and a reminder of the valuable skills that they obtained in this course.","abbr":"EAS","subject":"Engineering & Applied Sciences","num":"160LAB","type_pk":"LAB","type":"Laboratory","grading_description":"Pass/Not Pass (PNP)","grading":"PNP","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"0301","long_title":"Engineering Machine Shop","min_credits":"1","max_credits":"1","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASU","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":true}}]},"EAS149":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS146":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS152":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS161":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS155":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS145":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS156":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS168":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS166":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS148":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS165":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS162":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS154":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS493":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS249":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS150":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS143":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS254":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EAS141":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb724f2","regnum":"24444","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"EAS","num":"141LAB","title":"Small Groups: Calculus 1","section":"1","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Unknown","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Talbrt 103","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1500},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1550},"when":[{"_id":"618652e79c7904001eb7571e","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1500,"end":1550},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":40,"section":15,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660476a56f200297aaf44","course_id":"303107","title":"Small Groups: Calculus 1","description":"This Small Groups program helps students master the core curriculum of Calculus 1.

Problem solving in engineering practice (i.e., industry) differs from the problems typically encountered in the classroom. Notably, \"real world\" problems are ill-structured, have multiple conflicting objectives, non-engineering standards and constraints, require knowledge from multiple disciplines (even beyond engineering!) and necessitate working on a team.\n\nThe objective of this course is to allow students with an interest in engineering to explore an engineering identity. Through this exploration, students will gain an appreciation for the characteristics of good engineers: (1) Technical competence (technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, creativity; (2) Interpersonal skills (strong technical communication, effective teamwork); (3) Work ethic (attention to detail, diligence, persistence); and (4) Moral standards: honesty, integrity. This exploration will be facilitated through team projects, individual assignments and a professional development and career planning portfolio. The theme for this course will be consideration of the \"Grand Challenges for Engineering\" as defined by the National Academy of Engineers (www.engineeringchallenges.org)."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660476a56f200297aaf4a","course_id":"301351","title":"UB Seminar","description":"The three credit UB Seminar is focused on a big idea or challenging issue to engage students with questions of significance in a field of study and, ultimately, to connect their studies with issues of consequence in the wider world.

The Seminars provide students with an early connection to UB faculty and the undergraduate experience at a comprehensive, research university.
