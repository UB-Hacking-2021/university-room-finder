This course is the second class on basic applied econometrics. The objective of this course is to estimate causal effect using econometric models. You will learn how to implement and interpret the results using linear regression and non-linear regression models using actual data. These topics include randomized experiments, fixed-effects models, instrumental variables models, regression discontinuity models. The emphasis behind these models is causal inference and research design. You should also be able to use these various models to analyze data, and critically assess studies using these models. You should be able to articulate why a model may give misleading results, and what to do about such a problem. Understanding and being able to explain the key concepts is an important part of this course.

strategic behavior. What is strategic behavior? It is conduct by a person or a firm, for example, intended to achieve a specified goal; e.g. finding a low purchase price for a commodity or generating a high profit level. Often two entities have directly opposing goals. A simple example is that of a buyer and a seller since the buyer wants to trade at a low price and the seller wants to trade at a high price. In fact, when you think about it, most of the significant deliberate choices that you make each day are strategic. How can we, as scientists, predict accurately the outcomes of strategic conflicts between groups of adversaries? Game theory has become a very useful means of constructing such predictions. The course will examine the development of the theory and will highlight its achievements and failures when applied to economic problems.
