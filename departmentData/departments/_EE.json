The course begins with an overview of various models for wireless fading channels (flat/frequency-selective fading, Rayleigh/Rician/Nakagami fading, and Jake¿s fading channel simulator). Then, we introduce MIMO wireless communications systems and analyze system performance to understand the advantages of MIMO systems. We will also introduce various space-time (ST) coding and modulation techniques for MIMO systems (cyclic codes, unitary ST codes, diagonal algebraic ST codes, and ST codes from orthogonal designs) and discuss system/code design challenges. Finally, we discuss MIMO-OFDM systems for broadband wireless communications. The course concludes with applications of MIMO techniques in various IEEE standards.","abbr":"EE","subject":"Electrical Engineering","num":"620LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"0665","long_title":"Mimo Wireless Comm","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"EE777":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE797":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE760":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE796":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE585":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE591":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE594":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE771":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE581":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE699":{"total":32,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a69c7904001eb71313","regnum":"18433","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"EE","num":"699TUT","title":"Dissertation","section":"AS","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Sanyal,Arindam","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Arranged","campus":"Arranged","online":false,"room":"Arr Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652b39c7904001eb72a8b","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660476a56f200297ab0bf","course_id":"000001","title":"Dissertation","description":"The content of this course is variable and therefore it is repeatable for credit.
