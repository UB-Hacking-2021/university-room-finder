The remote interconnection of all types of devices, ranging from personal computers, cellphones and tablets, to data centers or distributed sensors, are at the basis of many of our daily activities. In this course, the fundamental concepts of telecommunication networks will be introduced. A bottom-up layered approach will be used to explain how the performance requirements of telecommunication networks have been traditionally solved. In particular, the functionalities of the physical layer, e.g., information modulation, transmission and reception; data link layer, e.g., flow control, error control and medium access control; network layer, e.g., information routing and forwarding; transport layer, e.g., end-to-end reliable transport and QoS provisioning, and application layer, will be discussed in detail. In addition to the theoretical lectures, guided experimental assignments with advanced network simulation and monitoring tools will be conducted to better illustrate the concepts learnt in the class. This course will provide the students with the necessary knowledge to understand current data communication networks as well as to contribute to the development of next generation telecommunication systems.  This course is dual-listed with EE 534.","abbr":"EE","subject":"Electrical Engineering","num":"434LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"0665","long_title":"Principles of Networking","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"EE 383 and EE 178; Senior Standing; Approved Electrical Engineering Majors or Minors Only.","requisites":"EE 383 and EE 178; Senior Standing; Approved Electrical Engineering Majors or Minors Only","prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"EE475":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE451":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE158":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE460":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE453":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE470":{"_id":"618652a79c7904001eb716b4","regnum":"19558","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"EE","num":"470LEC","title":"Ren Distbtd Gen & Storage","section":"000","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Burke,Kevin M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Frnczk 422","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1530},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1650},"when":[{"_id":"618652dc9c7904001eb74cf5","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1530,"end":1650},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MW"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":58,"section":15,"enrolled":15,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660476a56f200297ab04a","course_id":"300786","title":"Ren Distbtd Gen & Storage","description":"This course introduces a specific type of electric power system, the microgrid.

Topics will include a historical global perspective of electrical systems, individual enabling technologies that comprise a microgrid will be presented.  The class involves a design of a microgrid that incorporates and considers economic, environmental, sustainable, manufacturable, ethical, health and safety, social and political constraints.","abbr":"EE","subject":"Electrical Engineering","num":"470LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"0665","long_title":"Renewable Distributed Generation and Storage","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: EE 202 or EE 200 and Approved Engineering Majors or EE Minors only.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"EE 202 or EE 200 and Approved Engineering Majors or EE Minors only","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"EE338":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE445":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE443":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE455":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE458":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE464":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE468":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE444":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE210":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE208":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE335":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE439":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"EE178":{"total":7,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a69c7904001eb71305","regnum":"18419","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"EE","num":"178LLB","title":"Digital Principles","section":"000","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Burke,Kevin M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Davis 101","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1200},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1250},"when":[{"_id":"618652b39c7904001eb72a2e","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1200,"end":1250},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":true,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MWF"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":175,"section":160,"enrolled":15,"status":false},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660476a56f200297ab01c","course_id":"013229","title":"Digital Principles","description":"Topics include: number systems;
