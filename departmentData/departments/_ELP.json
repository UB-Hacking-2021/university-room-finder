In an effort to answer both of these questions, we begin by examining the economic and social benefits that accrue to individuals and then discuss how students and institutions are subsidized and how those subsidies affect affordability.

Such issues underscore the importance of increasing educational leader knowledge about inclusive practice. Students in this course will critically examine educational leadership strategies, programming, and relevant policies concerned with fostering inclusivity within school building and district environments. As such this course operates from the premise that students and educational staff possess unique talents and struggles, as well as have a continuum of physical, social, emotional, and intellectual needs. This course also focuses on what it means to ¿lead beyond inclusion,¿ by examining what educational researchers who work across the K-12 leadership-policy spectrum have to say about working with students who occupy different developmental and identity statuses, as well as may have experienced trauma. In doing so, course discussions will push students to be cognizant of the kind of discourse used in research and practice to discuss these issues (e.g., special education v. students with disabilities; at-risk v. underserved). Course activities and written assignments are designed to provide students with opportunities to develop critical, meaningful, and relevant sense-making that helps leaders to improve learning for all learners.

These external pressures and the resiliency of schools reflect the constant tension between demands for change and demands for constancy. Historically, attempts to reform schools generally have paid little attention to the social and political forces in the larger society that influence schooling, or to the organizational culture and structure within schools and the teaching profession. Recent literature and reform efforts, however, have begun to address some of these influences. This seminar is intended to help participants understand the complex range of issues involved in the process of school change and to improve their ability to act as change agents or to undertake research on the change process. Through a seminar format we will focus on critically examining: 1. the social, political, and organizational factors influencing school reform efforts; 2. the historical responses of schools to planned change efforts; 3. the goals and assumptions of current school reform policies; 4. the processes and strategies of changes being enacted in schools; and 5. the processes and strategies of promoting school improvement","abbr":"ELP","subject":"Educational Leadership &Policy","num":"637SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded

Similarly, notable variation exists in patterns of college matriculation, persistence and graduation, as well as linked graduate/ professional school experiences and later socioeconomic outcomes.   ELP 590 explores the relationship between education and social stratification processes in American society. This course will review sociological theories and empirical research that have been concerned with the connections between family of origin and educational outcomes, and between educational attainments and labor market outcomes. The course will pay close attention to multiple bases of stratification in American society, such as social class, gender, and race/ethnicity. Although literature is drawn primarily from the United States, some cross-national material will be employed. The topics and issues to be explored include: theories of stratification; status attainment models and social mobility; mechanisms of stratification, specifically as linked to schools; educational expansion and persistent inequality; and institutional arrangements of education systems and social stratification.   This course will provide a venue for students to think critically about the role of K-16+ institutions in explaining both educational and occupational attainment processes as well as launch their own research project on a topic of interest. The course will be valuable for those whose own work is centrally located in issues of stratification as well as those who wish to become more informed as to the ways in which educational institutions serve as ¿sorting machines¿ for the broader society.","abbr":"ELP","subject":"Educational Leadership &Policy","num":"590SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"1081","long_title":"Education and Social Stratification","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"ELP618":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb7249f","regnum":"24336","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ELP","num":"618SEM","title":"Sociology of Higher Education","section":"0","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Iantosca,Megan Marie","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Baldy 118","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1610},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1850},"when":[{"_id":"618652b39c7904001eb72a98","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1610,"end":1850},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":21,"section":20,"enrolled":5,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660486a56f200297ab180","course_id":"002720","title":"Sociology of Higher Education","description":"Higher education is a broad field and sociology provides an important and unique perspective with which to view the field.

The yearlong course is aimed at the analysis and execution of various qualitative research strategies, including understanding of their underlying assumptions and appropriateness for particular questions. Much of the course is practical in nature in that students engage in an original research project over the course of the year. Ethnographic techniques provide the major focus for the course. In semester II we will code, sort and analyze data collected during semester I and write up the results. Students must meet all requirements as outlined in the syllabus.  Students are expected to 1) participate in class discussion based on assigned readings and ongoing work with respect to their own projects; 2) code, sort, analyze and write up the data collected during semester I, and 3) meet all paper and presentation requirements as outlined in the syllabus, including intellectual and practical participation in the GSE graduate student symposium. As part of this course, students will present their findings to the class in mock conference format and we will workshop all papers before final submission.","abbr":"ELP","subject":"Educational Leadership &Policy","num":"594SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"1081","long_title":"Qualitative Research Methods Part II","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"ELP633":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP619":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP608":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP631":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP612":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP610":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP622":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP639":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP626":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP628":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP625":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP598":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP620":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP614":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP627":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP565":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP621":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP635":{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb70375","regnum":"13584","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ELP","num":"635SEM","title":"Lding an Eff Sch Dist","section":"000","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Marchioli,Karen L","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Baldy 479","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2140},"when":[{"_id":"618652de9c7904001eb74e8d","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1900,"end":2140},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":20,"section":20,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652fc9c7904001eb768f4","sequence":1,"note":"LIFTS COHORT 27 ONLY"}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660486a56f200297ab18d","course_id":"002740","title":"Lding an Eff Sch Dist","description":"Tis course examines the knowledge and skills necessary to perform in a variety of leadership roles and responsbilities at the district level.

Alternative paradigms to guide the structuring of inquiry into education issues and problems will be considered. Students are expected to develop a paper that: * identifies a specific problem (or issue) worthy of further investigation; * describes the significance of the problem within historical and contemporary contexts; * reports what is known and what remains unknown about the problem and related issues through a formal review of the literature; * Develops a formal conceptual framework of the problem based on the review of the literature; and * specifies research questions and/or hypotheses to be investigated to add to our understanding of the problem. Concern with research design and methods is only incidental to the primary focus of problem conceptualization. Permission of the student's advisor is required to participate in the course; and, students should consult with their advisors at key developmental points and keep their advisors informed of progress being made.","abbr":"ELP","subject":"Educational Leadership &Policy","num":"624SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"1081","long_title":"Paradigms and Problems in Educational Research","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"ELP772":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP770":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP630":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP786":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP792":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP794":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP774":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP781":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP796":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ELP629":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71e19","regnum":"22058","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ELP","num":"629SEM","title":"Human Res and Labor Rel in Edu","section":"0","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Ramming,Thomas M.","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Baldy 474","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1610},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1850},"when":[{"_id":"618652d59c7904001eb747bd","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1610,"end":1850},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":22,"section":20,"enrolled":5,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652ef9c7904001eb75c91","sequence":1,"note":"LIFTS 28 ONLY"}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660486a56f200297ab187","course_id":"002732","title":"Human Res and Labor Rel in Edu","description":"This course examines key conceptual and practical issues in the administration of Human Resources (HR) and Labor Relations (LR) in education.
