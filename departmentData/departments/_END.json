What is density, and what does it mean? What are the relations between density and sustainability? This graduate seminar is intended to examine density as a most profound indicator of human settlement pattern especially in urbanized areas. One of hypotheses that the class addresses is this: Is denser the city, the greener it is or is it? Through the use of provocative readings and comparative analysis and mapping techniques, we compare major cities around the world to understand the relation between urban density and urbanism, its economic and environmental robustness: placemaking, good urban form and great streets -- all contributing to making cities great and robust ecologically, economically and socially.","abbr":"END","subject":"Environmental Design","num":"566LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0226","academic_org":"0648","long_title":"Urban Design: Built Environment Case Studies","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"END576":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END578":{"_id":"618652ab9c7904001eb7204a","regnum":"22944","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"END","num":"578SEM","title":"Environmental Planning Methods","section":"U578","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Walters,Adam Scott","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"South Campus","campus":"South Campus","online":false,"room":"Hayes 402","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1140},"when":[{"_id":"618652e49c7904001eb75310","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":900,"end":1140},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":16,"section":5,"enrolled":2,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660486a56f200297ab236","course_id":"302569","title":"Environmental Planning Methods","description":null,"abbr":"END","subject":"Environmental Design","num":"578SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0226","academic_org":"0648","long_title":"Environmental Planning Methods for Sustainability","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"END568":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END641":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END643":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END583":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END645":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END563":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END628":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END638":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"END567":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71c6e","regnum":"21339","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"END","num":"567LEC","title":"Planning & Development Law","section":"U567","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Murray,William M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"South Campus","campus":"South Campus","online":false,"room":"Hayes 402","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1800},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2040},"when":[{"_id":"618652c89c7904001eb73c7c","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1800,"end":2040},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":16,"section":10,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660486a56f200297ab232","course_id":"302681","title":"Planning & Development Law","description":"Explores historical and legal foundations of planning and development.
