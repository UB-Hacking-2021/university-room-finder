This course will examine the role women have in sports, and how \"on the court\" performances and accomplishments have influenced the participation, opportunities and administration of women's sports. This impact can be demonstrated through the many facets of the female athlete experience from the rules of women's sports, the uniforms, salary, travel and the media coverage to name a few. At the conclusion of this course you will have a better understanding of the impactful women in sport, both at the amateur and professional levels. You will understand the changing role of the female sport administrators, head coaches, uniforms, media coverage, and competitions' rules and regulations.","abbr":"ES","subject":"Exercise Science","num":"251LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0448","academic_org":"0703","long_title":"Women, Gender & Sport","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASP","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"ES450":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ES448":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ES491":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ES451":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ES488":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ES498":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ES493":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ES492":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"ES495":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a89c7904001eb719e7","regnum":"20509","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"ES","num":"495TUT","title":"UG Supervised Teaching","section":"HK","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Kearns,Heather D","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"South Campus","campus":"South Campus","online":false,"room":"Arr Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652c59c7904001eb739c1","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":3,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660496a56f200297ab413","course_id":"302196","title":"UG Supervised Teaching","description":"Outstanding undergraduate students can enrich their education and gain personal recognition through participation in a supervised teaching experience with an Exercise and Nutrition Sciences faculty member.
