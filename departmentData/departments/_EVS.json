Some of the key processes in soil are nutrient cycling, soil aggregate formation, and biodiversity interactions. The diversity and abundance of soil life exceeds that of any other ecosystem.

The course explores what leadership in sustainability is and guides students to advance their related capabilities, competencies, and strategies. The personal, interpersonal, organizational and infrastructural dimensions of leadership in sustainability are each addressed. A variety of specific case studies and examples of sustainability in practice, including everything from urban green and blue spaces to environmental purchasing are explored. Interdependencies between finance, politics, interpersonal relationships, cognitive processes, capacity building, and technology are discussed. Students taking the course for credit in the Department of Environment and Sustainability, or any other department or major, as well as professionals, will leave with a deeper knowledge of leadership in sustainability as they are required to complete a project involving a real-life or fictitious leadership of their choice.","abbr":"EVS","subject":"Environment and

It exposes students to the mediating influence of international organizations, e.g., World Bank and the UN, on critical analysis and formulation of strategies and action plans for social change from a gender and sustainability perspective. The course examines historical origins, functions, the international and domestic political forces that impact the operations and effectiveness of international organizations, especially in the field of sustainable development and gender equality. Through weekly discussions, students explore the breadth of subject matter and the multidisciplinary nature of the scholarship. This course meets the requirements for GGS in two of its areas: women and global citizenship; and gender and public policy.

Why do some communities bounce back quicker from disasters than others? What can be done to increase resilience to natural hazards? \nThis course will explore the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of resilience, as well as some popular metrics and indicators to measure community resilience. We will also review and learn from case studies of disasters \nand disaster recovery. Students will also hear from a variety of guest speakers, representing different perspectives and disciplinary approaches to understanding resilience."}],"association":"2","catalog":{"_id":"618660496a56f200297ab49c","course_id":"302869","title":"Special Topics","description":"Special topics courses are offered to allow students to explore topics not in the standard curriculum.
