This particular course enriches specific intermediate-level skills for more advanced use: it focuses on investigating, persuading, and argumentation. It allows students to practice the forms of discourse necessary for defense and justification at the same time that it encourages critical thinking by scrutinizing and analyzing modes of persuasion intended to manipulate and evade. Course goals are achieved through the study of texts like essays, novels, films, and performances coming from various social contexts of French-language cultures as well as through the honing of written and verbal skills of inquiry, research analysis and synthesis necessary for exploring texts and their contexts.","abbr":"FR","subject":"French","num":"213LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded
