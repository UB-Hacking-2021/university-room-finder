The course starts from a foundational belief in the importance of studying women's experiences of their bodies and health. The main objective is to learn about how gender ideologies impact scientific research and practices around women's bodies, shaping women's abilities to learn about their bodies and their access to healthcare. This class is explicitly designed to both ground students in the best practices of scientific inquiry and to draw from work in the humanities and social sciences to understand how science is shaped by broader social beliefs and practices. Students will be able to use this perspective in discussions and activities that explore the role of gender, race, class, religion, and sexuality in shaping the study of women's bodies and health. The class will cover topics such as: women's health and disease, the anatomy of the female body; pregnancy and maternal health; and the need for a focus on the diversity of women's bodies and access to healthcare. This course also encourages students to examine what improvements can be made to scientific research and access to medical knowledge when it comes to women's health and care.","abbr":"GGS","subject":"Global Gender Studies","num":"103LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0405","long_title":"Women's Bodies, Women's Health","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"GGS110":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS105":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS106":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS104":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS127":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS108":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS117":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS107":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS102":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS155":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS109":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS116":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS101":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a29c7904001eb708cd","regnum":"15107","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"GGS","num":"101LEC","title":"Intro Gender & Wmn Studies","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Kagiavas,Kaylee Ourania","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Cooke 114","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":950},"when":[{"_id":"618652d09c7904001eb743ac","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":900,"end":950},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":true,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MWF"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":35,"section":30,"enrolled":6,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604a6a56f200297ab61d","course_id":"013745","title":"Intro Gender & Wmn Studies","description":"Introduces students to basic concepts in women's studies.

A solid grasp of the core theories, their fundamental approaches, their insights into social phenomenon and the key criticisms of each, will allow the student to enter into and participate in the ongoing conversations that characterizes feminist thought. Feminist theory has always developed in tandem with feminist movements and activism.  Thus, throughout the course, students will not only learn about feminist theories, but also apply the tenets of different theories to current issues and modern problems.  Theories are not meant to be passive ideas unrelated to our everyday reality, but are meant to be used as tools to analyze the world around us.  As a critical theory, feminist theory aims not only to produce knowledge, but also to provide a base for action. Feminist theories ask us to rethink what we mean by sex and gender, how we understand our sexuality, the roles, status, and ideals assigned to men and women in our societies and how we reward and punish individuals that question, challenge or deviate from these roles.  Feminist theory engages with issues of social inequality, oppression, and sexism, and invites us to imagine strategies for creating a world where there is more equality and liberation.","abbr":"GGS","subject":"Global Gender Studies","num":"228SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0405","long_title":"Introduction to Feminist Theory","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"GGS235":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS226":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS242":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS238":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS236":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS271":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS243":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS241":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS232":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS221":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS245":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS237":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS264":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS240":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS229":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS115":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS113":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS119":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS305":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS282":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS295":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS309":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS310":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS291":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS290":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS118":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS112":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS298":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS272":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS285":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS276":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS292":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS259":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS256":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS302":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS307":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS289":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS283":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS299":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS311":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS308":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a99c7904001eb71b2e","regnum":"20932","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"GGS","num":"308LEC","title":"Image and Gender","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Nutting,Mary Evalyn","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Cooke 127A","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1700},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1820},"when":[{"_id":"618652d89c7904001eb749af","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1700,"end":1820},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MW"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":40,"section":20,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652ec9c7904001eb759c3","sequence":1,"note":"This class features asynchronous online activities in addition to the real-time meeting pattern."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604a6a56f200297ab634","course_id":"013808","title":"Image and Gender","description":"Considers the representation of gender (femininity and masculinity) in pictures, and the impact of gender on making and looking at art and media.

Thus, clothing has come to be a vital element in the constitution of a vast number of social hierarchies including gender, race, sexuality, ethnic and nationality, and class. The now established field of fashion studies also engages the business of fashion, which encompasses trade, production, shopping, consumerism, advertising, social media, and celebrity culture. This course will investigate clothes both as artistic creations and as consumer products and will pay particular attention to the interplay between the two.  In sum, \"Making Fashion: Art, Ethics, and Practice\" will engage students in thinking critically about art, cultural production, history, and the rise of consumer capitalism through clothing and the practices of dressing in which students and indeed all individuals participate. While the history of fashion has long been focused primarily on the West since the Renaissance, this class will endeavor to place so-called \"birth of fashion\" in Europe into its global context by comparing and contrasting the art and practice of fashion around the globe and in an extended chronology.

Explores how women in Latin America and the Caribbean have participated in the national movements, revolutions, rebellions, and social movements that have dominated Latin America's political, social, and economic development.  Readings cover the incredible variety of women's participation by examining women's activism across time, space and political position. Women's struggles to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of others are a central component of the course.  However, to avoid romanticizing women's activism, the course also discusses women's actions on behalf of political projects designed to uphold the interests of the elite and the status quo.  Women in Latin America and the Caribbean, as elsewhere, live complicated lives, have complicated political goals and commitments, and have different access to political, social, and economic power depending upon their position within the class, racial, ethnic, religious, age, and gender hierarchies of their societies. Over the semester, we will analyze why women have been involved in political movements, the effects of women's activism on women's position within these societies, the changing relationship between men and women, contested understandings of gender relations, and the overall impact of these struggles on the Latin American and Caribbean countries.","abbr":"GGS","subject":"Global Gender Studies","num":"347SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0405","long_title":"Women in Latin America","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"GGS376":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS441":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS444":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS440":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS450":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS364":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS122":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS129":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS439":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS120":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS469":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS139":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS136":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS436":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS445":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS346":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS169":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS148":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS133":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS158":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS157":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS349":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS345":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS344":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS162":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS145":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS165":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS126":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS437":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS429":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS153":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS428":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS433":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS423":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS432":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS434":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS419":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS426":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS343":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS417":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS413":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS341":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS424":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS418":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS422":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS421":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS340":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS420":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS431":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS430":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS427":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS425":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS415":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS414":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS411":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS416":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS128":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS134":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]}}
