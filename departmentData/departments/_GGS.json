We will consider the roles of gender, race, class, and sexuality, and think about how feminist art addressed, challenged, and changed discriminatory politics of difference. We will analyze artworks in relation to their historical and social contexts and from a variety of art historical methodologies; and we will examine feminist works in all media from painting and sculpture to performance, conceptual, and installation art, and from photography, film, and video to multimedia. Our discussions will be informed by first, second, and third-wave feminism, as well as queer theory and feminist activism.","abbr":"GGS","subject":"Global Gender

To escape the plague, a group of ten young men and women find refuge in a villa outside of Florence and start telling each other stories, whose subjects range from tragic stories of love and loss, hilarious pranks, and misadventures with a happy ending. Thanks to its combination of intriguing events and fascinating characters, the Decameron offers a privileged point of view to explore early modern society. The short stories will serve as a starting point to explore the daily life of early modern men and women, with particular attention to topics such as the relationship between genders, religion, morality, politics, and -- last but not least -- life during a pandemic."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604a6a56f200297ab678","course_id":"019261","title":"Special Topics","description":null,"abbr":"GGS","subject":"Global Gender Studies","num":"560SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0405","long_title":"Special Topics","min_credits":"1","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}}]},"GGS658":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS554":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS651":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS653":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS577":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS567":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"GGS570":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71de9","regnum":"21973","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"GGS","num":"570SEM","title":"Int'l Orgs Gender & Sustain","section":"WEJ","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Wejnert,Barbara","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"On Campus - TBD (CSS)","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1400},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1640},"when":[{"_id":"618652b69c7904001eb72d40","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1640},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"T"},{"_id":"618652d49c7904001eb746bd","sequence":2,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1640},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":10,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604a6a56f200297ab67a","course_id":"019263","title":"Int'l Orgs Gender & Sustain","description":"This course explores the role of international organizations, including the United Nations, in addressing sustainability and gender equality.

The course examines historical origins, functions, the international and domestic political forces that impact the operations and effectiveness of international organizations, especially in the field of sustainable development and gender equality. Through weekly discussions, students explore the breadth of subject matter and the multidisciplinary nature of the scholarship.
