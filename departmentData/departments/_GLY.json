Stratigraphy is the backbone of the geological sciences; it brings together sedimentology, paleontology, petrology and structural geology to reconstruct Earth history. Sequence Stratigraphy goes even further by integrating additional disciples such as geophysics, geomorphology, isotope geochem, and basin analysis through application of integrated data. In this course we will survey the impact of sea-level change, tectonics, and climate on sediment accumulation, with emphasis on sequence stratigraphy and integration of seismic data/techniques and core analysis. This course will cover basics of fluid flow and sediment transport, sedimentary structures and textures, and forming the bridge between modern landforms and ancient rocks' depositional sedimentary environments.

It covers the fundamentals of experimentation on rocks, minerals, magmas, and fluids and how to employ their results to understand and simulate geologic processes. The course is aimed at advanced undergraduate students as well as graduate students interested in learning common experimental techniques, why they are useful and where the limitations to experimental geosciences lie. Topics include the rheology of magmas and lavas, rock deformation and failure, and fluid flow in porous media.
