But how did marijuana get to be illegal in the first place? Who decided that some drugs are so dangerous we should fight a war against them, while others are so beneficial that entire industries should be devoted to encouraging their use? Why are American debates over drugs so intense and so complex, and why have they produced such a contradictory legal and cultural landscape? This course answers such questions by exploring the rich history of alcohol and other drugs in America: from the Pilgrims¿ beer riots to Prohibition, from cocainized Coca-Cola to ¿crack¿ cocaine, from Bayer¿s Heroin to Purdue Pharmas OxyContin, from the Marlboro Man to vape lounges, from vipers to hippies to ravers. We will track the changing worlds of drug discovery and commerce; drug use and drug-using subcultures; drug regulation and policing (domestic and global); drug treatment and addiction science; and the shifting, racialized cultural politics of drugs.

The Crystal Palace was a massive glass structure that covered almost nineteen acres of ground and showcased some of the most spectacular examples of British ingenuity produced by a century of industrial growth in canals, railways, and factories.  HIS 321 will look at both the self-congratulatory and hopeful world of Great Britain and the British empire during the reign of Queen Victoria as well the underside of that world that included new depths of Dickensian poverty, famine in Ireland and the grisly East End of Jack the Ripper. We will explore a range of themes, including: urbanization, class tensions, industrial change, imperialism, gender, socialism, rural nostalgia.  In particular, the class will chart the rise of industrial wealth, the problems of urbanization, the expansion of the British empire, and the development of an interventionist state.

How do we understand the effects of poisons on our body? How do we make the best use of these potent matters that can benefit us and the society at large? These are some of the fundamental questions to the history of medicine, and driving ones for this course. Examining the history of poisons through twelve case studies, we will explore the complexity of poison materiality by contemplating the intimate relations between poisons, medicines, and foods. We will learn how the experiences of the body shaped the conceived values of poisons. We will examine the circulation of poison knowledge across social and geographical domains. Using specific poisons as the anchor of our analysis, we will explore the social fabric and cultural milieu in which particular ideas and practices of poisons emerged, flourished, or diminished. One key aspect of the course is to introduce a comparative perspective to the study of medical history. By studying above topics in both European/American and Asian contexts, we will identify surprising parallels, striking differences, and hidden connections between these traditions. Finally, we will ponder how knowledge of poisons in the past illuminates our notions and habits of ingesting and experiencing drugs today. This course is the same as AS 492.

Thus, clothing has come to be a vital element in the constitution of a vast number of social hierarchies including gender, race, sexuality, ethnic and nationality, and class. The now established field of fashion studies also engages the business of fashion, which encompasses trade, production, shopping, consumerism, advertising, social media, and celebrity culture. This course will investigate clothes both as artistic creations and as consumer products and will pay particular attention to the interplay between the two.  In sum, \"Making Fashion: Art, Ethics, and Practice\" will engage students in thinking critically about art, cultural production, history, and the rise of consumer capitalism through clothing and the practices of dressing in which students and indeed all individuals participate. While the history of fashion has long been focused primarily on the West since the Renaissance, this class will endeavor to place so-called \"birth of fashion\" in Europe into its global context by comparing and contrasting the art and practice of fashion around the globe and in an extended chronology. This course is the same as GGS 273.

It begins with an examination of Jesuit missions to Japan and China, as well as the role that India played in the establishment and maintenance of these missions. The different Jesuit strategies for accommodating or rejecting indigenous religious beliefs and customs are compared and considered, as well as the Nestorians in China much earlier. Then we turn to the unique way in which Catholicism was subsequently established in Korea, where Christianity has enjoyed unparalleled success in East Asia. We will look closely at how Christianity has affected and been affected by socio-political developments, its interactions with and influence upon traditional Asian religions, its relationship to nationalism since the late 19th century, and its tensions and conflict with colonialism and Communism in the 20th century. It concludes by asking what factors might have enabled Christianity to have such success in Korea (and the Philippines) and compare these to the situation in China and Japan. This course is the same as AS 374 and course repeat rules will apply.  Students should consult with their major department regarding any restrictions on their degree requirements.

We will also explore popular culture as a realm of performance and a powerful site for the creation of female images and ideals.  Finally, we will examine birth control, abortion, sexual danger and sexual pleasure as important personal as well as political issues in women's lives.  How much have women's lives changed since the 19th century?  Have women of varied ages, racial/ethnic communities, and social class been empowered by these changes?
