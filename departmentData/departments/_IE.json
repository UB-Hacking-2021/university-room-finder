Integer programming encompasses models with a mixture of discrete and continuous decision variables, and ones for which efficient algorithms are not likely to be found.  On the other hand combinatorial models may deal with problems having pure discrete elements for which clean and efficient procedures exist.  This latest class includes Network Optimization.  This course will place emphasis on Integer Programming and related areas.  The course is a good one for students who are planning to apply OR tools in Production or Manufacturing problems or supply chain/service/logistics related problems as well as continue using an optimization software tool called CPLEX.","abbr":"IE","subject":"Industrl & Systems

Operations Research","description":"This is an applied Operations Research course, where the focus is on the utilization of the analytical tools that students have learned in other Operations Research courses to study problems of urban significance. The course starts off with a review of basic probabilistic concepts. The first topic covered is that of geometrical probability, a powerful tool to approach urban problems. Then a discussion on queuing theory is presented. This is followed by a discussion of spatial queues that are used in modeling urban emergency service systems. The next topic is on network problems that are useful in an urban context. The final topic is on simulation modeling as applied to urban problems. All topics are reinforced with real-world examples and in-depth homework assignments.","abbr":"IE","subject":"Industrl & Systems Engineering","num":"678LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0301","academic_org":"0309","long_title":"Urban Operations Research","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"IE746":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE775":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE740":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE721":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE768":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE735":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE719":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE745":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE674":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE760":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE762":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE733":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE765":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE728":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE724":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE748":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE774":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE720":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE673":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE736":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE681":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE675":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE764":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE732":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE743":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE749":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE727":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE754":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE753":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE755":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE780":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE751":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE778":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE777":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE756":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE752":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE779":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE792":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE791":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE739":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE782":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE798":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE784":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE797":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE795":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE788":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE794":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE793":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE796":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE786":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE785":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE787":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE799":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"IE783":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]}}
