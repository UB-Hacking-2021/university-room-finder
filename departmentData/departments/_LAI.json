It then describes an approach to the teaching of reading and writing called strategic literacy instruction. The focus throughout is on discovering ways to help struggling readers and writers: students usually referred to as \"low performing,\" \"general,\" or \"developmental;\" students perceived as learning-disabled, resistant, at-risk or lower-track; students in special education classes or in classes where special students are mainstreamed; or kids who are just plain unmotivated. Evaluation includes a midterm report and a final project concerned with designing strategy-based literacy instruction.","abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and Instruction","num":"414LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0659","long_title":"Adolescent Writing Across the Curriculum","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASPSU","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":true}},"LAI399":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI413":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]}}
