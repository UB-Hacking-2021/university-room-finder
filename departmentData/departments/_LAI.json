The class will function as a reading group discussing short texts, some of which have become multicultural classics, including literature written by African American, Asian Americans, Latino/a, Native Americans (e.g., by Cisneros, Kinkaid, Walker, Wilson, Momaday, Tan, Petry, Alexie, and others). As we respond aesthetically to literary works and share those responses in writing and discussion, we will also examine the ways that individuals and groups make sense of these texts. The course is grounded in cultural, constructivist approaches to literature and will focus, too, on how authors construct texts out of their own sets of experiences in cultural contexts. Students will have some choice in selection of texts which suit their interests and needs.","abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and Instruction","num":"512LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0659","long_title":"Readings in Multicultural Literature","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAI563":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI544":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI562":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI535":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71ec2","regnum":"22322","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAI","num":"535SEM","title":"Environmental Education","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Schindel,Alexandra Eleanor","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Park 152","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1610},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1900},"when":[{"_id":"618652e09c7904001eb74fef","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1610,"end":1900},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":24,"section":24,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297aba4f","course_id":"003246","title":"Environmental Education","description":"This course provides content, methods, and resources to be used in developing and implementing an instructional program of environmental education.

Why and for what purposes? How does the notion of linguistic correctness fit into the intelligent teaching of reading and writing? How does grammar teaching fit into standards and standards-based assessment, and how does it mesh with issues in multicultural education and urban schooling? Finally, what, realistically, can we expect to gain from the time we spend teaching language and usage? To answer these questions, this course offers a view of language diversity and literacy based in sociocultural and sociolinguistic theories of literacy learning. The course pays special attention to what sociocultural approaches tell us about the ongoing debate over the teaching of grammar and usage. It discusses the language and literacy-learning strategies students bring from home and how these strategies can be used for facilitating the learning of academic writing, grammar, and usage. The practical side of the discussions and readings focuses on two separate issues: what teachers should know about grammar, usage, style, and mechanics; and what, how, and why teachers should teach grammar, usage, style, and mechanics.","abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and Instruction","num":"537LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0659","long_title":"Language Diversity and Literacy","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAI608":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI602":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI605":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI529":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI607":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI600":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI610":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb724a2","regnum":"24339","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAI","num":"610LEC","title":"Supvsn Music Lrng Progms","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Victor,Richard Dale","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652b39c7904001eb72a9c","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":" "}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":30,"enrolled":2,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abaa4","course_id":"005876","title":"Supvsn Music Lrng Progms","description":"Nature and scope of music supervision; supervisory relationships, procedures, and techniques; guiding educational change in PreK-12 music; organization and administration of music programs; development of evaluative criteria for improving music, teaching and learning.","abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and Instruction","num":"610LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0659","long_title":"Supervision Music Learning Programs","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAI604":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI606":{"_id":"618652a59c7904001eb71166","regnum":"17943","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAI","num":"606LEC","title":"Cur Instrct Fndtns Mus Ed","section":"LOA","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Chase,Gregory Keith","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652b59c7904001eb72c52","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ASYN"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":25,"enrolled":4,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abaa0","course_id":"005872","title":"Cur Instrct Fndtns Mus Ed","description":"A study of the current role and practice of music education considered in historical, philosophical, psychological and sociological perspective.

We will carefully examine how to build an intercultural community of learners in our classrooms, how to make our classrooms culturally inclusive; how to develop culturally compatible pedagogical strategies, and how to use cultural diversity as a powerful resource for the benefit of all students. This is an experiential, discussion-based, and workshop-oriented course appropriate for all GSE master's and doctoral students, allowing everyone a maximum of active participation with an emphasis on creative thinking and sharing personal experiences. The final projects are open to student interests and offer opportunities for exploring the implications of this work for teaching, leading, counseling, and researching.","abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and Instruction","num":"567SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0659","long_title":"Intercultural Interactions/Multicultural Classroom","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAI565":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71ef1","regnum":"22426","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAI","num":"565LEC","title":"Lit for Child & Yng Peopl","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Boyd,Maureen Patricia","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1610},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1850},"when":[{"_id":"618652ca9c7904001eb73e2e","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1610,"end":1850},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":24,"enrolled":12,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297aba70","course_id":"005158","title":"Lit for Child & Yng Peopl","description":"The study of children's literature has grown increasingly important in the past decade due in part to an explosion in this area of publication, as well as to the emphasis in many schools on literature-based instruction. Furthermore, beyond the pedagogical value of learning to read, children's literature is a significant cultural artifact, one that has \"power to celebrate, perpetuate, interrogate, subvert, expose, and even openly defy cherished myths and deeply entrenched ideological assumptions\" (Butler, Dillard, & Keyser, 1996). In this course we examine historical and contemporary literature for children in order to identify not only the traditional elements of literature and illustrations, but to identify as well the myths and ideological assumptions of authors and illustrators. Topics include: the definition and depiction of families, multicultural selections, gender roles, expository text, and visual literacy.","abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and Instruction","num":"565LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0659","long_title":"Literature for Children and Young People","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAI574":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb703c5","regnum":"13668","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAI","num":"574SEM","title":"Tchng Exceptional Learner","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Finocchio,Bobbie","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652e19c7904001eb75136","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ASYN"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":24,"enrolled":8,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297aba7a","course_id":"017827","title":"Tchng Exceptional Learner","description":"The purpose of this course is to aid in understanding diversity by preparing teachers to offer direct and indirect services to students within the full range of disabilities and special health-care needs in inclusive environments.

We will foreground gender (and sexuality, feminisms, masculinities, femininities) and attend to intersections with multiple dimensions of inequality including but not limited to race, ethnicity, indigeneity, religious identity, citizenship, able-ism, refugee, migrant. The second goal of the course is to examine how the key concepts can be used to analyze curriculum, instruction, learning,  and education policy. A last goal of the course is to apply this knowledge as a student, an educator, counselor, librarian, activist, administrator, parent, or education researcher. Questions we will ponder throughout the semester are: What is intersectionality? What does it have to do with education? What do theories and methodologies of intersectionality reveal to us about teaching, learning, assessment, knowledge/curriculum, school administration, or policy?

The purposes of LAI 669 are three-fold. One purpose is to understand something of qualitative research. This means looking at the conceptual roots, assumptions, and methodologies of qualitative research both by itself and in relation to quantitative approaches. A second purpose is to locate our work in educational settings. We do this because, while qualitative research is not restricted to schools and classrooms, those sites are increasingly viewed as ripe for qualitative analysis. The third purpose is to provide opportunities to \"do\" some qualitative work. In-class and out-of-class activities are designed to provide students with real occasions to apply their theoretical learning.","abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and Instruction","num":"669SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0659","long_title":"Qualitative Tech for Education","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAI676":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI708":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI672":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI654":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI691":{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb703bc","regnum":"13659","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAI","num":"691LEC","title":"Tchg Eng Sec Lang:Practcm","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Cauller,Timothy William","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Clemen 103","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1720},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1850},"when":[{"_id":"618652e19c7904001eb75130","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1720,"end":1850},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":44,"section":25,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652fd9c7904001eb76b02","sequence":1,"note":"STRICT PI                "}],"association":"2","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abafb","course_id":"001352","title":"Tchg Eng Sec Lang:Practcm","description":"This course is organized around a structured, practical experience of language teaching.

perspectives on how technology interacts with the individual, society, institutions, economy, and culture. It explores concepts relevant to structure and practice, focusing on technology as a means and a means to an end. Thus, this course will focus on the writings of Jacques Ellul, Martin Heidegger, Don Idhe, Ivan Illich, Arnold Pacey, Joseph C. Pitt, and Edward Tenner among others. It will explore the cultural, institutional, and technical aspects of technology as mechanisms to understand and evaluate the transformations that technologies undergo as they are moved through and interact with different dimensions of society. Using historical analysis of watersheds in medicine and transportation, the major foci are:     The inherent nature of technology     Technological progression and efficiency     Technological tools as part of systems     Dynamics of technology within communities     Expertise as embedded within development and adoption of technology Objectives Students will: (1) Apply a critical approach to the development and use of technologies in various dimensions of societal institutions (e.g. classroom teaching and learning). (2) Approach technologies from a process, activity (design and development) and product lens. (3) Use a philosophy of technology framework to evaluate current research in their respective fields of interest (e.g. science, mathematics, literacy education). (4) Explore, evaluate and discuss research implications of a philosophy of technology framework.","abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and Instruction","num":"671SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0232","academic_org":"0659","long_title":"Philosophy of Technology","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAI733":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAI673":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb724d8","regnum":"24415","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAI","num":"673SEM","title":"New Literacies Seminar","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Rish,Ryan M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Baldy 117","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2140},"when":[{"_id":"618652df9c7904001eb74f5b","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1900,"end":2140},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"R"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":34,"section":18,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abae8","course_id":"024037","title":"New Literacies Seminar","description":"This course engages students in a collaborative investigation of topics and theories that surround the field of New Literacies¿focusing on the new kinds of texts and uses of texts created by social and cultural influences (e.g., the computer).

Developing tools for teaching and learning presents an opportunity to support teacher practice while enacting a vision of K-12 CS as a culturally-sustaining, justice-oriented practice, and imagining ways in which K-12 CS might contribute to broader transformation of our schools and communities. Over the semester, teams of students will articulate a learning goal and then design, build, deploy, and analyze a computational tool in partnership with a school or community organization.

Design- based research involves the orchestration and study of complex educational interventions in naturalistic settings. In contrast to methods that are strictly observational, design-based research seek to shape and even engineer learning environments and experiences ¿in the wild.¿ Design experimentation might focus on such endeavors as: the creation of a new instructional sequence, the development of a new professional development approach, the development of a new exhibit or the design of a new learning technology. This form of inquiry necessarily involves foundational features of design practice as well as quantitative and qualitative research as appropriate.\n\nThis course has two main purposes. First, it introduces students to different design based research methods in educational research. Second, it provides students with an intensive experience in carrying out their own design-based research studies. Through a combination of readings, lectures, demonstrations, discussions, site visits and class exercises, students will be introduced to the issues and practices associated with design based research and how different researchers engage in this kind of work. By learning about the work of different researchers, students will also be introduced to distinct forms of design-based research in education. In their practicum experience, students will apply what they have learned to the design and conduct of their own design-based research studies.\n\nThis course is not a substitute for coursework on quantitative or qualitative methods.\nThis course is actually intended to complement such courses. I will provide an overview of the modes of inquiry that can be used in the study of education in which design-based methods play a prominent role. This will often involve employing qualitative or quantitative methods as central components to the research."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abaf2","course_id":"017950","title":"Sel Topics","description":null,"abbr":"LAI","subject":"Learning and

Learning is contextual and for every individual, learning is a socio-cultural experience grounded in local systems (values, tradition and practices). 2. Learning is an ongoing process that is grounded in multiple environments that the individual experiences throughout life. 3. Learning is supported by various societal constructs that contribute to the personal and intellectual development of the individual. 4. Learning is most powerful when the learners develop concepts in a language supported by their community."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abae0","course_id":"024033","title":"Sociocul Dimns Lrng & Humn Dev","description":"Research in learning sciences supports a view of learning that contends learners construct knowledge in multiple contexts (schools, home, third spaces, etc.) and learn optimally when content and pedagogies are grounded in their socio-cultural environment.
