This course will prepare students by focusing on legal issues that commonly arise in the context of civil litigation. Using one civil case file, students explore all phases of civil litigation, from intake through appeal. Students will conduct legal research, analyze legal problems and authorities, draft a variety of legal documents, complete distinct legal skill exercises, and write an appellate brief. This course will help students to develop sophisticated legal research skills, refine their legal analysis, and hone their legal writing. It will also reinforce fundamental civil procedure and legal practice concepts. Students will learn how to draft pleadings, develop an understanding of how discovery tools are used to obtain evidence to support your claim or defense, draft a pretrial motion brief, and develop an understanding of essential appellate concepts such as finality, preservation, and interlocutory appeal.

These rules, practices, and principles are deeply implicated in American legal life beyond the courtroom. This course introduces students to the basic structure of the civil lawsuit. We take the litigants¿ perspective to cover how people start, pursue, and try to end lawsuits. We take the courts¿ perspective to see how judges manage litigation. And we take a systemic perspective to understand how the authority of courts is constructed, constrained, and distributed in our dispersed system of adjudication. Throughout the course, we track how competing values play out in seemingly neutral choices about adjudicative process. Through class discussion and application problems, students practice placing themselves in the position of the attorneys they will become, and facing the legal and the ethical dilemmas that are key to legal work.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"501LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Civil Procedure","min_credits":"4","max_credits":"4","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASP","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"LAW531":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW535":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW536":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW560":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW550":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW542":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW518":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW541":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW534":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW567":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW532":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW551":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW544":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW552":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW561":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW573":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW545":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW537":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW547":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW553":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW546":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW555":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW543":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW516":{"total":6,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71d2b","regnum":"21575","career":"LAW","term_id":"2221","session":"Law 15 Week Session","session_id":"15W","abbr":"LAW","num":"516LEC","title":"Legal Analys, Writing & Res II","section":"U2","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Odunsi,Tolulope F","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 210","start":{"date":"2022-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","time":1300},"end":{"date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","time":1430},"when":[{"_id":"618652e99c7904001eb75819","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","start":1300,"end":1430},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MW"},{"_id":"618652e99c7904001eb7581e","sequence":2,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","start":1030,"end":1200},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":true,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TWR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":48,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abb5b","course_id":"013691","title":"Legal Analys, Writing & Res II","description":"This is the second semester of a full-year required course designed to introduce students to legal analysis, legal research and legal communication.

What strategies are used by defense attorneys to defend white collar criminals before and after charges are filed?

What issues arise if a corporation is paying attorneys to represent its employees during a criminal investigation? What criminal statutes are applicable? These are the types of issues that will be discussed during this course.

Various investigative techniques and strategies used by the prosecution will be highlighted, including the use of the grand jury, search warrants, interviews of witnesses by special agents and the use of informants.      We will examine and discuss white collar crimes committed against individuals, corporations and the government such as mail and wire fraud, tax evasion and bribery. Case law regarding issues in white collar prosecutions, such as evidentiary and other trial issues, will be discussed. Students will be asked to participate extensively in class discussions regarding hypothetical issues, case law and current prosecutions as they are developing.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"643LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"White Collar Crime","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAW642":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW662":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW657":{"total":2,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652a99c7904001eb71afe","regnum":"20867","career":"LAW","term_id":"2221","session":"Law 12 Week Session","session_id":"LC1","abbr":"LAW","num":"657LEC","title":"Election Law","section":"GAR","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Gardner,James A","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 108","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":900},"end":{"date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","time":1030},"when":[{"_id":"618652dc9c7904001eb74d13","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","start":900,"end":1030},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":80,"section":50,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abbe9","course_id":"016858","title":"Election Law","description":"Democracy does not just happen by itself; it must be implemented and institutionalized by constitutional and legislative means.

Most Federal litigation - civil rights, copyright, environmental law - focuses on the interpretation of a statute.  Whether you are a litigator, judicial clerk or academic, you will need to be adept at the variety of ways that a statute can be interpreted: - based on its construction by courts or enforcing agencies, legislative history, or textual scrutiny.

This course picks up where basic Trial Technique leaves off.  It is more in-depth and concentrated in its focus and time commitment. The students will organize and analyze a complicated fact pattern by focusing on the elements of proof, defenses and by developing a theme of the case.  In each session, students will, under the guidance of the instructor, guest judges and trial lawyers, work on a different aspect of a selected case. In the process they will sharpen their skills in the mechanics of trial lawyering:  how to ask proper questions on direct and cross examination, impeachment with a prior inconsistent statement, introduction and use of objections.  The student performances in each aspect of the trial will be critiqued on the spot so that they can identify their weak points and improve upon them for the next session.  In the trial competition, the students will try a case against top student trial lawyers from across the country.  Competitions are either invitationals which involve trying both sides of a criminal or civil case at least twice, and up to 5 to 6 times depending on whether the team advances past the preliminary rounds.  The competitions usually take 3 to 4 days. With the National Trial Competition and ATLA Competition, if the team wins the Regional, they advance to the Nationals and repeat the process. Actual trial judges and trial lawyers serve as judges and evaluators.  Course schedule varies from semester to semester and ordinarily consists of frequent meetings during a 6-week period. The time commitment is generally 3 nights a week and Saturday or Sunday mornings with all sessions running about three hours.  This course counts toward the maximum of 12 credits that a student is permitted to receive from independent studies, externships, and courses in other UB academic units.  Note:  Students enrolled in this course will receive 3 credits.  Students may be eligible for an additional 3 credits if they advance from a Regional Competition to a National Competition during one semester or if they are selected to participate in two competitions in two semesters.  In no event shall any student receive more than 6 credits for this course.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"651TUT","type_pk":"TUT","type":"Tutorial","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Trial Advocacy","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASP","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"LAW652":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW670":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW659":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW638":{"total":4,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"6186529d9c7904001eb6fc3d","regnum":"11433","career":"LAW","term_id":"2221","session":"Law 12 Week Session","session_id":"LC1","abbr":"LAW","num":"638TUT","title":"Trial Technique","section":"ROE","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Roemer,Cathleen","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 114","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1800},"end":{"date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","time":2100},"when":[{"_id":"618652d39c7904001eb745df","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","start":1800,"end":2100},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":17,"section":8,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abbd0","course_id":"016555","title":"Trial Technique","description":"The purpose of this course is to offer an opportunity to gain some experience in the actual trial of a lawsuit.

Davis once remarked, a case well stated is a case half won. By this, Davis meant that cases are more often won or lost on how well lawyers weave the facts into a compelling story than on how well they articulate the law. Thus, former students who are, and faculty who were, trial lawyers regularly remind me about the crucial importance in any litigator of the ability to tell a story. Experience corporate lawyers say the same thing about doing and deal.  However, stories do not tell themselves, whether they are seen on the page or on the screen. Stories are shaped by the author, and derivatively by the director. What that shaping accomplishes is the subject of this course. Thus, it is designed to improve your ability to tell a story by examining how master storytellers shape their stories. During the semester we will read great three novels and a good play, chosen because there exist at least two contrasting movie versions of each. The novels are Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Emma, all by Jane Austen. The play, Sabrina Fair by Samuel A. Taylor formed the basis for two movies called Sabrina. In order for you to have time to read the first novel we will begin the course with two films -- Mostly Martha and No Reservations that share a text, though the text is unavailable to me and, in any case, is written in German. In class we will discuss, and thus compare, how each director shapes the implicit story. Thereafter, we will first discuss how the author shapes the story, and then, after seeing the two film versions, discuss how each director shapes/reshapes the pre-existing story. Papers will be due throughout the semester. Initially they will be short analyses of the films and text. About the middle of the semester the papers will lengthen and shift to the job of shaping the kind of stories that lawyers tell. Indeed, I do not enjoy reading either film scholarship or literary theory. It is as a lawyer/law professor that I have gotten interested in the romantic comedy as an exemplar of the art of storytelling. If you cannot abide the form, you best not take the course.  Note:  As there will be movies shown you must be available for all hours included in the class schedule.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"683LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Telling Stories: A Course for Aspiring Civil and Criminal Litigators","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAW660":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW661":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW666":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW668":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW676":{"_id":"618652a49c7904001eb70e77","regnum":"17075","career":"LAW","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAW","num":"676LEC","title":"Intro to Health Economics","section":"LAW","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Noyes,Ekaterina Ivanovna","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Farber 180","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1600},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1730},"when":[{"_id":"618652c89c7904001eb73c60","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1600,"end":1730},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":48,"section":2,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652ef9c7904001eb75cc5","sequence":1,"note":"Cross listed course - Begins on 1/28.

As defined by the legal profession, ¿labor law¿ refers to the federal statutes and judicial decisions that address the formation and governance of the collective bargaining relationship between labor unions and business enterprises. This course will explore five broad areas of labor law: (1) the historical evolution of labor relations law, including labor law before the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA); (2) the establishment of the collective bargaining relationship, including the rights that employees have under the NLRA to ¿form, join, or assist labor organizations,¿ the kinds of tactics and actions that are permissible or prohibited prior to the election of a union as a bargaining representative of the employees, and what kinds of employee groups constitute appropriate units for collective bargaining; (3) the negotiation of the collective bargaining agreement, including the nature of union representation under the law, the duty to bargain in good faith, and which subjects for bargaining are ¿mandatory¿ or merely ¿permissible¿ topics for negotiation; (4) the regulation of strikes, picketing, and boycotts, including the kinds of economic actions that are protected, unprotected, or prohibited; and (5) some final, but important, components, including the nature, administration, and continuity of the collective bargaining agreement; the breadth of federal preemption of labor law over attempts by states to regulate in similar areas; and the relationship between the individual and the labor union. As an introductory course to labor law, we will be primarily concerned about the preceding list of ¿trees.¿ But I also hope to weave in, throughout the course, important questions about the ¿forest.¿ In particular, I hope we can raise and discuss questions about the role and futures of labor unions in an age of rising income inequality, declining union membership rates, globalization, and technological and industrial change.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"693LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Labor Law","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAW709":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW714":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW718":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW710":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW702":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW697":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW715":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW720":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW717":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW707":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW704":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb72592","regnum":"24623","career":"LAW","term_id":"2221","session":"Law 12 Week Session","session_id":"LC1","abbr":"LAW","num":"704SEM","title":"Crim Law: Sentencing & Prisons","section":"HAR","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Harrington,Alexandra Reed","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 706","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1500},"end":{"date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","time":1800},"when":[{"_id":"618652e89c7904001eb75795","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","start":1500,"end":1800},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":20,"section":15,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abc2c","course_id":"012719","title":"Crim Law: Sentencing & Prisons","description":"There are more than 2 million people incarcerated in the United States.

When two rules seem to apply to the same situation and call for contrary courses of action, how should a person decide which rule to follow?  What force should a rule have in situations in which it is not clear whether the rule applies? (In other words, if the law is vague about whether a particular rule applies to the situation I am in and I choose not to follow the rule, how much trouble can or should I get into if a court later decides that the rule does apply?) When and why does or should a higher authority (such as an appellate court) defer to decisions made by an entity subordinate to that higher authority (for example, a trial court or administrative agency)? In addition, we will spend time developing skills in argument mapping (i.e., creating diagrams such as flow charts that visually represent the arguments in a legal decision, brief, or other text).","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"737LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Topics in Jurisprudence","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAW740":{"_id":"618652ac9c7904001eb72204","regnum":"23566","career":"LAW","term_id":"2221","session":"Law 12 Week Session","session_id":"LC1","abbr":"LAW","num":"740LEC","title":"Public International Law","section":"MEL","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Melish,Tara Jane","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 25","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1300},"end":{"date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","time":1430},"when":[{"_id":"618652e99c7904001eb75818","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","start":1300,"end":1430},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MW"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":81,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abc6d","course_id":"007553","title":"Public International Law","description":"This basic international law course explores the elementary and foundational sources, norms, and institutions in the field of contemporary international law.

This seminar examines the idea that cooperation is essential because natural resources like rivers, wind, forests, air, soil, mineral deposits are often transboundary resources. No single country or people group can fix problems as they arise. Our interdependent eco-systems provide something to build upon in working towards long-lasting peace. This concept works even in high conflict situations where there¿s longstanding ethnic, political, or religious hostility; the parties are encouraged to focus on the interests they have in common, rather than the issues that divide them. This seminar will examine how to use cooperative stewardship over natural resources with an eye toward: Economic stability (the promotion of eco-tourism, responsible manufacturing and industrial use, sustainable power generation, agricultural production, and related businesses); social-cultural stability (the continued enjoyment and recreational use of natural resources, preservation of a traditional way of life; continued sustenance fishing and agriculture, water and food security; biological diversity; historical research, archaeological discovery and preservation) and political stability (security issues, natural boundaries and protection, navigation, migration, population growth, balance of power and access to natural resources.)

Topics covered include Chapter 11 bankruptcy, out-of-court workouts, distressed exchange offers, prepackaged bankruptcy and debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"763LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Acquisition and Restructuring Transactions","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAW726":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW761":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW758":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW762":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW768":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW723":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW724":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW776":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW760":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71d32","regnum":"21591","career":"LAW","term_id":"2221","session":"Law 12 Week Session","session_id":"LC1","abbr":"LAW","num":"760SEM","title":"Rep Rights & Reprod Justice","section":"FIN","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Finley,Lucinda M","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 706","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1500},"end":{"date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","time":1800},"when":[{"_id":"618652ba9c7904001eb73012","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","start":1500,"end":1800},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":20,"section":18,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abc94","course_id":"009027","title":"Rep Rights & Reprod Justice","description":"The law directly regulates or indirectly affects most aspects of human reproduction and reproductive health, and the impact of laws and policies in this area can vary greatly for women and men based on their age, economic class, work status, race, immigration status or criminal justice system status.  This course will examine the many ways in which The U.S. legal system regulates, restricts, interferes with, stigmatizes, coerces, or supports human fertility, conception, pregnancy, and birth through the lens of reproductive justice ¿ a lens that considers not just what the extent of rights pertaining to reproductive autonomy are, but that focuses on the disparate impact of laws and policies on women of different races, economic classes, and social status. We will cover issues such as access to and funding for contraception and abortion; religious liberty based objections to providing reproductive health services; access to prenatal care and factors affecting the high rate of maternal or fetal mortality or poor health outcomes in the U.S.; barriers to tort recovery for reproductive harm during prenatal care; pregnancy discrimination or accommodation in the workplace and family leave policies; access restrictions to reproductive health care for immigrant women, incarcerated women, and women in the military; forced medical treatment for pregnant women or coerced sterilization; and the differential access to and impact of assisted reproductive technologies.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"760SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Reproductive Rights and Reproductive Justice","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"LAW788":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW772":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW786":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW765":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW784":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW769":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW780":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW782":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW771":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW781":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW787":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW779":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW722":{"_id":"618652a89c7904001eb7188c","regnum":"20127","career":"LAW","term_id":"2221","session":"Law 12 Week Session","session_id":"LC1","abbr":"LAW","num":"722SEM","title":"Int Res Writing Sports Law","section":"DRE","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Drew,Helen A.","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 706","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1800},"end":{"date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","time":1930},"when":[{"_id":"618652b99c7904001eb72fdd","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","start":1800,"end":1930},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":20,"section":10,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abc4e","course_id":"012682","title":"Int Res Writing Sports Law","description":"This course provides a unique opportunity for independent, intensive research and writing into current topics in sports law.

In the offline world, law routinely regulates these activities, but should the rules of the game change in more virtual settings?  This seminar will tackle this broad question from a variety of perspectives, combining readings in psychology, communications, and marketing with study of legal texts.  This semester the seminar will pay particular attention to how privacy law, intellectual property law, and contract law have responded (or failed to respond) to the challenges of new technologies.  For example, should the government restrict what kind of data advertisers can collect and use from our online activities?  Should it make a difference when a website¿s terms of service state that the user forfeits any rights to personal information disclosed online?  What is the appropriate governmental response to the problem of online ¿trolls¿ and ¿cyberbullying¿?  Should a child¿s expression in social media made off school grounds potentially subject her to in-school punishment?  Grades will be determined on the basis of class participation and the completion of a substantial research paper.  In the paper, students will be encouraged to investigate a new technology, its potential social effects, and discuss what legal response (if any) is appropriate.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"795SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded
