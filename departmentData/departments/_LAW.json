The course will also cover the manner in which these substantive laws are enforced through the governmental institutions¿police, prosecutors, and regulatory agencies¿that are charged with their administration. Last, students will be introduced to constitutional limitations, such as the Bill of Rights, that constrain the power of the government in cases where individual rights are implicated. In short, this course will provide students with a basic understanding of the relationship between the government and the individual in American law.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"202LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Public Law","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FA","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"LAW159":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW175":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW407":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW405":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW404":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb725cd","regnum":"24695","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAW","num":"404LEC","title":"The Jury Trial","section":"MUR","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Murray,Glenn","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 108","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1830},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2110},"when":[{"_id":"618652e99c7904001eb75805","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1830,"end":2110},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":80,"section":30,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abb4b","course_id":"302514","title":"The Jury Trial","description":"This course will introduce students to the origins, history, procedures, and challenges of the jury trial.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"404LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"The Jury Trial","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisites: LAW 101, LAW 201, LAW 202.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"LAW 101, LAW 201, LAW 202","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"LAW401":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW165":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW178":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW397":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW406":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW167":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW390":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW184":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW387":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW398":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW396":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW394":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW177":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW391":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW388":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW400":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW187":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW399":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW376":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW393":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW395":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW380":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"LAW402":{"total":3,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652ab9c7904001eb71fdb","regnum":"22801","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAW","num":"402LEC","title":"Special Topics","section":"LIN","section_status":"A","alt_title":"Post-national Constitution","instructor":"Linden-Retek,Paul Peter","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 212","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1400},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1640},"when":[{"_id":"618652e09c7904001eb75025","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1640},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":44,"section":40,"enrolled":6,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f49c7904001eb76036","sequence":1,"note":"¿¿his is a course about the legitimacy of law in times of globalization. Developments in global law are reconfiguring the state-centric model of sovereignty common to the 19th and 20th centuries. Contemporary forms of international and transnational governance now interpret cosmopolitan norms, enforce basic human rights, and claim administrative authority beyond the nation-state. This seminar conducts a multi-disciplinary study¿drawing on political philosophy, critical legal and social theory, history, socio-cultural studies, and ethics¿of alternative models of sovereignty and law and considers their implications for the understanding and enforcement of rights post-nationally. Special focus will be given to histories of international institutions, humanitarian intervention, the constitutional pluralism of the European Union, recent developments in the laws of the United States and the European Union regarding immigration and the right to asylum, and global debates on migration."}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186604d6a56f200297abb4a","course_id":"302746","title":"Special Topics","description":"Specialized topics in law.","abbr":"LAW","subject":"Law","num":"402LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0317","academic_org":"0317","long_title":"Special Topics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisites: LAW 101 and LAW 201 or LAW 202","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"LAW 101 and LAW 201 or LAW 202","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FA","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},{"_id":"618652ab9c7904001eb72037","regnum":"22913","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"LAW","num":"402LEC","title":"Special Topics","section":"KEL","section_status":"A","alt_title":"Specialized Criminal Inves","instructor":"Kelly,Cydney Anne","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Obrian 214","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1830},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":2110},"when":[{"_id":"618652e49c7904001eb752fe","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1830,"end":2110},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":35,"section":35,"enrolled":10,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f09c7904001eb75dea","sequence":1,"note":"This course explores substantive and procedural issues arising in the investigation, prosecution and defense of white collar crimes and other special investigations.
