We examine their geographical distribution, the particular (socio-)historical events in which they arise and how they relate to the languages that participate in their formation. Along with the historical aspect, we examine the cultural and population mix that also emerges in these contexts, language use in various areas of society (education, administration, rituals, everyday life, entertainment, etc.) and the social structure reflected by their usage. Finally, we explore language attitudes and policies which directly correlate with the history of these languages. Creoles, Pidgins and mixed languages from all over the world will be considered in this course, with a particular emphasis on those that developed in within territories that are now part of the United States such as Hawaiian Pidgin, Gullah-Geechee, Louisiana Creole, and Michif as well as those that developed elsewhere but are now spoken by contemporary communities in the United States such as Haitian Creole and Cape Verdean Creole.
