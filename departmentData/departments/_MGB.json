you successfully undertook during participation in LeaderCORE Foundations I. It picks up where LeaderCORE Foundations I ended and assumes familiarity and practice with the LeaderCORE competencies model and a good baseline understanding of your  current competency profile, including your strengths and weaknesses. LeaderCORE Foundations ll will focus on you building your competencies, primarily through the medium of action learning. This will  include a project carried out in teams. It will be supplemented by regular reviews of individual and team progress, practical class activities featuring student-to student learning, interactions with experienced external leaders, class dialogue and self-selected development activities. All development is, in effect, self-development and it is expected that LeaderCORE development will continue to be achieved outside the context of this course, and captured through the reflection process.","abbr":"MGB","subject":"Organization & Behavioral Sci","num":"631SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded
