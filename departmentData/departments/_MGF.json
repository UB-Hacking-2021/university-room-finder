This is a rigorous course that requires students to be familiar with basic investments and calculus concepts.

Basic knowledge of differential calculus is expected. Basics of stochastic calculus will be covered.

In a case-study we will use R programming to replicate the risk-neutral price of a variance swap (underlying the so called Volatility Index or VIX). The course will be of particular interest for students who contemplate pursuing a career in the financial industry, e.g. as a Quantitative Analyst. The required prior courses depend on your trajectory (e.g., MGF 633 \"Investment Management\" or MGF 634 \"Quantitative Methods in Finance\"). Please consult your study guide for details. In general, students are expected to possess good knowledge of mathematics and statistics. Students should also feel comfortable with Excel and some basic programming knowledge will be helpful.
