Managerial Process","description":"Historically, managers have considered decision making as an art; something learned by trial and error; something based on creativity, judgment, intuition, and experience. This course gives you a structured way of attacking a wide range of real problems, using data-driven analysis to guide decision-making.  We will consider how to think about and manage uncertainty and risk, how to translate data about the business into useful insights, how to put value on various courses of action, and how to generally make informed decisions. The main focus of the course will be on modeling decisions in the spreadsheet  environment, illustrated by applications from operations, finance, marketing, and human resources. The approaches and techniques for decision-making are useful throughout the firm, both within functional areas and for the essential management challenge of working across functional boundaries.","abbr":"MGG","subject":"General Management","num":"633LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0377","academic_org":"0377","long_title":"Model Managerial Process","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"SP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},{"_id":"6186529d9c7904001eb6fbe0","regnum":"11323","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"MGG","num":"633LEC","title":"Model Managerial Process","section":"S2G","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Cichocki,Dianna Marie","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Alfier 103","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1400},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1520},"when":[{"_id":"618652d39c7904001eb7459a","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1520},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MW"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":42,"section":40,"enrolled":35,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"2","catalog":{"_id":"6186604f6a56f200297ac0c0","course_id":"011727","title":"Model Managerial Process","description":"Historically, managers have considered decision making as an art; something learned by trial and error; something based on creativity, judgment, intuition, and experience.
