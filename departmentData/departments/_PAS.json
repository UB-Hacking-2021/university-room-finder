Upon completing the course, the students will be able to recognize, predict, and interpret the biochemical derangements in various endocrine disorders and to correlate these with structural alterations.","abbr":"PAS","subject":"Pathology & Anatomical Science","num":"620LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0456","academic_org":"1149","long_title":"Endocrine Pathology","min_credits":"1","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"PAS607":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS623":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS615":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS609":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS610":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS621":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS631":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS598":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS605":{"_id":"618652a89c7904001eb71889","regnum":"20124","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PAS","num":"605LEC","title":"General Pathology Introduction","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Ignatowski,Tracey A","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":900},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1150},"when":[{"_id":"618652b99c7904001eb72fdb","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":900,"end":1150},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":30,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660556a56f200297ac76e","course_id":"301816","title":"General Pathology Introduction","description":null,"abbr":"PAS","subject":"Pathology & Anatomical Science","num":"605LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0456","academic_org":"1149","long_title":"Principles of General Pathology and Basic Disease Mechanisms","min_credits":"1","max_credits":"1","requisites_description":"Pre-Requisite: PAS 500 or PAS 503 or PAS 505.","requisites":null,"prerequisites":"PAS 500 or PAS 503 or PAS 505","corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"PAS611":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS614":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS622":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS617":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS628":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS627":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS634":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS613":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS629":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS602":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS603":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PAS599":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71cbf","regnum":"21429","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PAS","num":"599LAB","title":"Supervised Teaching","section":"GRD","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Derby,Laurie A","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Arranged","campus":"Arranged","online":false,"room":"Arr Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652e69c7904001eb75576","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":" "}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":6,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660556a56f200297ac76b","course_id":"003449","title":"Supervised Teaching","description":"Graduate students who are involved in teaching the laboratory have taken the course in previous years and are involved in teaching.

Immunobiology","description":"It is increasingly clear that a bidirectional interaction between the central nervous system and the immune system is not only functional, but plays an important role both in normal physiology and in pathological states.  In fact, the nervous system and the immune system share parallel molecular pathways, and consequently, communication between neurons and cells of the immune system participates to a significant extent in homeostasis and disease.  This course incorporates hands-on research, library-based investigation, and discussions and presentations based on current topics in neuroimmunology, including: inflammation, effect of neurotransmitters on immune cell functions, chronic pain, neuro-degeneration and aging, depression, and antidepressant mechanism of action, as well as more recently, diabetes.  We will focus our discussions on cellular and molecular mechanisms shared by the immune and nervous systems and the cross-talk between these two unique and diverse systems.  Specific research projects are designed to cover a select topic in neuroimmunology of interest to both the student and advisor.  The project chosen will lead to a publication in a peer-reviewed journal, fundamental for the future career goals of the student.  Additionally, students should be prepared to lead discussions on preselected papers for each laboratory meeting.","abbr":"PAS","subject":"Pathology & Anatomical
