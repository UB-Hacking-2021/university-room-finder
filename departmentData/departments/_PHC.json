Computer modeling and simulations is a basic tool for such analysis and a variety of programs have been developed to facilitate this process. This course will provide instruction necessary to understand selected program operations, examples of data sets and models used for analysis, and exercises and problems designed to learn in class how to implement and execute the modeling tasks. The course will consist of a series of 1-2 day workshops that will have a format of a lecture followed by a hands-on session where students will run the programs under the supervision of the instructor. Each workshop agenda will aim at presenting the basics of the program such as installation, user interface, syntax, data management, acquiring help, reporting results, as well as showing how the program can be used to accomplish typical tasks of PK/PD data analysis such as simulation, parameter estimation, noncompartmental analysis, study design, bioequivalence, etc. After completing the workshop, the student should be able to use the program independently for his/her research projects and continue the self-learning process while working with the program.","abbr":"PHC","subject":"Pharmaceutical Sciences","num":"512TUT","type_pk":"TUT","type":"Tutorial","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0508","academic_org":"0511","long_title":"Pharmacometric Software","min_credits":"1","max_credits":"1","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"PHC506":{"_id":"6186529e9c7904001eb70007","regnum":"12559","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PHC","num":"506LEC","title":"Biometry in Phc Sci","section":"LEC","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Bies,Robert R.","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"South Campus","campus":"South Campus","online":false,"room":"Pharmacy 268","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1300},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1450},"when":[{"_id":"618652b89c7904001eb72e4e","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1300,"end":1450},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":true,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"TR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":39,"section":30,"enrolled":5,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660556a56f200297ac894","course_id":"014110","title":"Biometry in Phc Sci","description":"PHC 506 is a required 3 credit course designed for first year graduate students of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.
