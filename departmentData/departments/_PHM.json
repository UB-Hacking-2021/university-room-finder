The primary goal of this course is to provide students identified as the future leaders of our profession with the tools necessary to develop their ability to effectively lead others, inside and outside their profession. Students will be assigned introductory readings in the following areas: identifying oneÂ¿s strengths; people skills, personalities, and networking; relationships and working effectively with others; team-building and team-managing; professionalism and ethics; supervising, managing, and leading; developing a professional practice vision, setting goals, and establishing priorities; and, integrating oneÂ¿s personal life and career. Students keep a reflective journal or complete an assignment for each reading, detailing: what they learned from the reading; the statement, passage or quote that was most profound to them; and an example detailing how they incorporated what they learned into their professional life. Classroom discussions will be student led, facilitated by the course coordinator, and will be based on readings, reflective journal exercises, and cases.","abbr":"PHM","subject":"Pharmacy","num":"550LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded

PHM 562 represents the spring semester requirement of the P2 year. Students will be asked to perform and complete tasks including but not limited to, patient and interprofessional interactions, dispensing techniques, formulating pharmaceutical preparations, patient counseling, drug delivery devices, medication therapy management, service learning, medication error prevention and reporting, pharmacoinformatics, and wellness clinics. The theme of this particular course will be Â¿first-time pharmacy practiceÂ¿, meaning P2 students are now licensed pharmacy interns in NYS and can perform actual pharmacy practice activities under the supervision of a pharmacist. They will complete approximately 50 hours during the fall semester and 50 hours during the spring semester (minus any hours they were able to complete previously during the summer). All students will also participate in group reflection sessions, various professional training and related assignments, case studies, as well as the continuation of documenting and reflecting on all experiences via their IPPE journal. These experiences and related activities will continue to be integrated with the doctor of pharmacy curriculum to further enhance their clinical skills and contribute to their overall development as a pharmacy healthcare professional.","abbr":"PHM","subject":"Pharmacy","num":"682TUT","type_pk":"TUT","type":"Tutorial","grading_description":"Pass/Not Pass (PNP)","grading":"PNP","academic_group":"0508","academic_org":"0512","long_title":"Intro Pharm Pract Exp 2b","min_credits":"1","max_credits":"1","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"PHM674":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM690":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM673":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM679":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM706":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM685":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM707":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM648":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM719":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM704":{"_id":"618652a99c7904001eb71afc","regnum":"20865","career":"PHRM","term_id":"2221","session":"Non Standard","session_id":"NON","abbr":"PHM","num":"704LEC","title":"Pediatrics and Geriatrics","section":"LEC","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Fusco,Nicholas","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"South Campus","campus":"South Campus","online":false,"room":"Pharmacy 190","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1300},"end":{"date":"2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","time":1420},"when":[{"_id":"618652b69c7904001eb72cf6","sequence":3,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","start":1330,"end":1450},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"T"},{"_id":"618652b69c7904001eb72cf7","sequence":4,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","start":1500,"end":1620},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":true,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"T"},{"_id":"618652d19c7904001eb74469","sequence":5,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","start":1630,"end":1750},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"},{"_id":"618652d99c7904001eb74a88","sequence":2,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","start":1300,"end":1420},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":282,"section":160,"enrolled":49,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660566a56f200297ac999","course_id":"300891","title":"Pediatrics and Geriatrics","description":"Upon completion of this course students should be able to advance the level of clinical patient management through the understanding and utilization of pharmacotherapeutic principles.

This course marks the end of the third and final level of progressive IPPE activities where students are to complete a minimum of 150 hours of experiential education throughout their third professional year. PHM 662 represents the spring semester requirement of the P3 year. Students will be asked to perform and complete tasks including but not limited to, patient and interprofessional interactions, dispensing techniques, formulating pharmaceutical preparations, patient counseling, drug delivery devices, medication therapy management, service learning, medication error prevention and reporting, pharmacoinformatics, and wellness clinics. The theme of this particular course continues to be Â¿mini-APPEÂ¿ rotations, meaning it will attempt to mimic and directly prepare students for the full-time advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) which takes place the following year. A P3 student will complete minimally 40-55 hours of experiential education during the spring semester. All students will also participate in group reflection sessions, various professional training and related assignments, case studies, as well as the continuation of documenting and reflecting on all experiences via their IPPE journal. These experiences and related activities will continue to be integrated with the doctor of pharmacy curriculum to further enhance their clinical skills and contribute to their overall development as a pharmacy healthcare professional. At the conclusion of this semester, each student will have completed a minimum of 150 hours during their third professional year and a total of at least 300 hours of IPPE activities since starting pharmacy school.","abbr":"PHM","subject":"Pharmacy","num":"782TUT","type_pk":"TUT","type":"Tutorial","grading_description":"Pass/Not Pass (PNP)","grading":"PNP","academic_group":"0508","academic_org":"0512","long_title":"Intro Pharm Pract Exp 3b","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"PHM779":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PHM598":{"total":31,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652ab9c7904001eb7208f","regnum":"23053","career":"PHRM","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PHM","num":"598TUT","title":"Professional Problems","section":"BOJ","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Boje,Kathleen Mary Karlinski","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1500},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1700},"when":[{"_id":"618652ba9c7904001eb7303b","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1500,"end":1700},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"W"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":25,"enrolled":17,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f29c7904001eb75ef8","sequence":1,"note":"Register for 2 (TWO) credits if taking Health Care Inequities from a Pharmacist Perspective"}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660566a56f200297ac96d","course_id":"019344","title":"Professional Problems","description":"Independent study.
