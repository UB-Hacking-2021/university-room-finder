This course will also refer to specific disorders of the nervous systems and their treatment in addition to giving an overview of the techniques used for the study of neuropharmacology.  The course will focus on human diseases involving chronic pain, drugs of abuse, and neurodegeneration (such as Parkinson's and Multiple Sclerosis). The course comprises both lectures and recitation periods which will vary by instructor and are designed to foster class participation, reading of primary literature (as well as textbook reading) and critical evaluation of research data to develop knowledge in the discipline of neuropharmacology.
