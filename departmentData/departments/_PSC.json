Students will come to know the basic functioning of American political institutions and understand the ways in which they have changed over the years. At the end of the course, they will be able to relate the institutions and behavior that have been discussed to a variety of core concepts and persistent problems that arise any time humans are confronted with the prospect of taking collective action. The course will cover how parties, interest groups, public opinion, the media, campaigns, and the institution of federalism influence the political process. Finally, students will become familiar with the scientific approach to the study of politics and develop an understanding of political science as a unique discipline. This course is a controlled environment (impacted) course. Students who have previously attempted the course and received a grade other than W may repeat the course in the summer or winter session; or only in the fall or spring semester with a petition to the Dean's Office of the College of Arts and Sciences.","abbr":"PSC","subject":"Political Science","num":"101LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0359","long_title":"Introduction to American Politics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FASP","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"PSC126":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC125":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC121":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC128":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC133":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC129":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC117":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC110":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC114":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC167":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC104":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC111":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC112":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC109":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC116":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC105":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC123":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC119":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC108":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC106":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC115":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC120":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC122":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC102":{"_id":"618652a09c7904001eb703c3","regnum":"13666","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PSC","num":"102LEC","title":"Intro Internat Politics","section":"MCL","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"McLean,Elena V","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Knox 110","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1000},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1050},"when":[{"_id":"618652b79c7904001eb72d5a","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1000,"end":1050},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":true,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MWF"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":222,"section":220,"enrolled":9,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660576a56f200297aca9d","course_id":"019269","title":"Intro Internat Politics","description":"This course introduces students to contemporary and historical international relations centered on the scientific study of international politics and the principal forms of international conflict and cooperation.

The course compares the institutions and policy choices made by different Eastern European countries and then explores how those choices contributed to the different outcomes experienced by these countries. As part of this comparison, students consider the impacts of other factors such as nationalism, democratic values, political stability, the nature of economic reform, and ethnic fractionalization.

Next, students will consider how the differences between developing and developed countries shape their interstate relations and account for differences in their political economies. Finally, the course will discuss contemporary issues and how relations between developing and developed countries are likely to change in the future. Specific topics covered in this course include the North-South wealth divide, dependency theory, the politics of economic reform, societal transformation via modernization, the effects of globalization, the problems of nation-building, the impact of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and the politics of foreign aid.","abbr":"PSC","subject":"Political Science","num":"342LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0359","long_title":"Politics of Developing Nations","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"OC","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"PSC341":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC350":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC335":{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71e0b","regnum":"22027","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PSC","num":"335LEC","title":"American Foreign Policy","section":"TUR","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Turner,Joshua Aaron","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652c49c7904001eb7393c","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ASYN"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":60,"enrolled":10,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660576a56f200297acac2","course_id":"017150","title":"American Foreign Policy","description":"This seminar is designed to introduce students to the historical and contemporary issues related to U.S. foreign policy.

The course then examines the most recent presidential election with evidence about the context of recent elections, the fundamental context in which the campaign was conducted, the key events of the campaign, and the preference polls leading up to the vote. The course then turns to the broad history of presidential elections, examining the impact of ¿the fundamentals¿ that shape campaigns, the ¿playing out¿ of those fundamentals through the candidates and campaign events in presidential elections, and both the systematic or regular aspects of campaign effects on elections and the unsystematic or ¿wild card¿ developments of campaigns. By examining presidential campaigns in both depth and breadth, students will learn about how presidential campaigns work, about evaluating and applying evidence to answer social scientific questions, and about relating those empirical answers to democratic theory.","abbr":"PSC","subject":"Political Science","num":"344LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0359","long_title":"Presidential Campaigns","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"FA","fall":true,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"PSC284":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC238":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC340":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC315":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC332":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC297":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC302":{"_id":"618652a69c7904001eb7134a","regnum":"18501","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PSC","num":"302LEC","title":"Protecting Civil Liberties","section":"DON","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Donahue,Shawn J","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Unknown","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652df9c7904001eb74f8d","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":" "}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":0,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660576a56f200297acaa9","course_id":"019274","title":"Protecting Civil Liberties","description":"This course analyzes the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States produced by the Justices in cases regarding fundamental civil liberties.

Game theory assumes that individuals act strategically to best pursue their goals, or maximize their welfare (utility), contingent on their expectations about the incentives faced by others whose decisions will influence the relative payoff of their action. The course will explore the fundamental assumptions that game-theoretical models make about human behavior as well as how individuals act strategically in contexts where information asymmetries exist that prevent them from perfectly anticipating the decisions of other actors. Depending on the instructor, the course will cover the application of game-theoretic models to topics in international relations or domestic politics.","abbr":"PSC","subject":"Political Science","num":"393LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0359","long_title":"Game Theory and Politics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"EOSP","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":true,"summer":false}},"PSC384":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC377":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC385":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC379":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"PSC373":{"_id":"618652a99c7904001eb71ad9","regnum":"20820","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PSC","num":"373LEC","title":"International Futures","section":"ONG","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Ong,Han Ping Derrick","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Talbrt 115","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1300},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1350},"when":[{"_id":"618652d99c7904001eb74a60","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1300,"end":1350},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":true,"thursday":false,"friday":true,"saturday":false},"pattern":"MWF"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":49,"section":49,"enrolled":5,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660576a56f200297acad3","course_id":"017171","title":"International Futures","description":"How will international relations change over the next 40 years? Will war and conflict become more or less frequent? What effects will globalization and climate change have on the international political system? Will climate change eventually lead to land disputes and food shortages that increase the likelihood of conflict or will it force countries to work together to address its effects? Will globalization continue unabated, bringing citizens closer together and thereby reducing nationalism and interstate conflict, or will it heighten the likelihood of conflict by exacerbating wealth differences? Similar questions can be asked about the future of the European Union, the long-run prospects for peace in the Middle East, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the impact of artificial intelligence on international relations. This course seeks to answer questions like these by placing the student in the position of policy-makers who must rely on forecasting and the analysis of long-run trends in international politics. The course will explore how long-run changes in technology, demographics, economic integration, resource scarcity, climate, and democratization could alter the nature of international relations. Students will consider competing theories about the effects of these factors on international politics and explore what their arguments imply about the cumulative effects of these factors over several decades if expected trends hold.","abbr":"PSC","subject":"Political Science","num":"373LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0359","long_title":"International Futures","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"OC","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}},"PSC376":{"_id":"618652ad9c7904001eb7259e","regnum":"24636","career":"UGRD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"PSC","num":"376LEC","title":"Money in Politics","section":"HAQ","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Haq,Rumiz James","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652c49c7904001eb73945","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ASYN"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":50,"enrolled":8,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"618660576a56f200297acad4","course_id":"017174","title":"Money in Politics","description":"Investigates how political campaigns have been funded and explores the impact of campaign financing on election outcomes and on the behavior of elected officials in making public policy decisions.","abbr":"PSC","subject":"Political Science","num":"376LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0359","long_title":"Money in Politics","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":"OC","fall":false,"winter":false,"spring":false,"summer":false}}}
