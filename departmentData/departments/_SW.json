Students will become familiar with evidence-based practice, within a recovery-oriented paradigm, as a general approach to practice as well as specific evidence-based interventions to use for individuals with a diagnosis of serious mental illness.  It is assumed that students will have a basic knowledge on serious mental illness as a pre or co-requisite, however a review will be provided.  Students will learn to examine research literature to determine the various levels of support for specific interventions and essential principles for translating research into practice.  In addition, they will identify the appropriate treatment outcomes that reflect effective, quality, mental health practice.  Each evidence-based practice presented will also be examined for its utility with diverse groups.  Providing assessment and treatment to a diverse group of individuals with a diagnosis of serious mental illness is the focus of this course and will be discussed in detail.","abbr":"SW","subject":"Social Work","num":"557LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0372","academic_org":"0372","long_title":"Evi-Based Ment Hlth Prac","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"SW528":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW565":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW517":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW529":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW571":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW601":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW547":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW582":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW580":{"_id":"618652a19c7904001eb707cf","regnum":"14833","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"SW","num":"580LEC","title":"Psychopathology","section":"AON","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Kim,Isok","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Remote","campus":"Remote","online":true,"room":"Remote","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652c19c7904001eb736b4","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ASYN"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":100,"enrolled":75,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[{"_id":"618652fc9c7904001eb7697a","sequence":1,"note":"Elective\n\nTechnical Requirements:  Broadband, Adobe reader  Flash Player  Media Player  Mac QuickTime  Web browser ¿ Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Blackboard App if using an IPad or Tablet"}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186605a6a56f200297ad01b","course_id":"003941","title":"Psychopathology","description":"SW 580 provides a general introduction to the fields of abnormal psychology and clinical psychiatry.  Specifically, this course intends to acquaint students with the epidemiology, classification, and etiology, of the major forms of mental illness.  It will be the primary aim of this course to develop the student's diagnostic skills in clinical settings.  To that end, didactic emphasis will be placed not only on the study of psychopathological symptoms and behaviors, per se, but also on their manifestations in everyday life.  Specific attention is paid to the ethical and social work value-related problems associated with diagnosing and labeling clients with a psychiatric disorder, and issues of race, ethnicity, culture, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disabilities or illness, age and national origin as they influence the manifestations of behaviors that may be diagnosed as mental illness or affect the presentation of mental illness.  Case studies and videos will be used to ensure that students have an effective working knowledge of: (a) the biological and psychosocial bases of the major mental disorders; (b) the behavioral symptomatology that characterizes them; and (c) their classification according to the American Psychiatric Association system of classification of mental illness. This course also addresses the role of social workers as advocates for people with mental disorders and as environmental change agents.","abbr":"SW","subject":"Social

The course will highlight the importance of self-reflection and self-awareness of one's own experiences of early childhood, as well as cultural histories and capacities.","abbr":"SW","subject":"Social Work","num":"727LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0372","academic_org":"0372","long_title":"Introduction to Infant Mental Health","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"SW679":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW721":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW726":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW693":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW725":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW681":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW671":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW766":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW743":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW767":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW719":{"_id":"618652a59c7904001eb711b8","regnum":"18032","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"SW","num":"719LEC","title":"Additional Field Experience","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Lewis,Laura A","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"Off Campus (US Only)","campus":"Off Campus (US Only)","online":false,"room":"Off Ca Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652b09c7904001eb7284f","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":30,"enrolled":1,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186605a6a56f200297ad053","course_id":"301220","title":"Additional Field Experience","description":"This optional course is for students interested in an extra field experience.

Restorative Justice brings social justice to the criminal justice system, schools, and communities. With youth, Restorative Justice is an evidence-based approach towards improving school climate; interrupting the school-to-prison pipeline that disproportionately affects youth of color; and creating safe and supportive environments without resorting to punitive responses.  In this class, students will learn and practice restorative justice skills, particularly skills in conducting restorative justice circles in schools and other community settings. Students will identify restorative justice techniques, learn implementation guidelines, and understand how and why the process works. We will explore using proactive circles to create positive communities and reactive circles to manage behavior and engage people in their issues. Students with an interest in working in criminal justice settings, neighborhood community centers, schools, child welfare settings, and other organizations serving children, youth, and adults are encouraged to take this course. Upon completion of the course, students will receive a certificate of skills acquired issued by the Erie County Restorative Justice Coalition.","abbr":"SW","subject":"Social Work","num":"722LEC","type_pk":"LEC","type":"Lecture","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"0372","academic_org":"0372","long_title":"Restorative Justice Certificate Training","min_credits":"2","max_credits":"2","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"SW779":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW765":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW797":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW798":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW682":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW689":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW729":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW724":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW673":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW672":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW705":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW688":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW707":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW737":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW692":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW702":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW675":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW691":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW676":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW704":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"SW710":{"_id":"618652a39c7904001eb70d54","regnum":"16738","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"SW","num":"710LEC","title":"Loss/Grief Across Life","section":"A","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Waldrop,Deborah P","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Norton 216","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":1400},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":1650},"when":[{"_id":"618652b19c7904001eb72918","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":1400,"end":1650},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":true,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"M"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":38,"section":30,"enrolled":33,"status":true},"exam":true,"notes":[{"_id":"618652f89c7904001eb763f8","sequence":1,"note":"Elective"}],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186605a6a56f200297ad04d","course_id":"300899","title":"Loss/Grief Across Life","description":"This course will focus on the central human experiences of loss, grief and bereavement that occur across the life course.
