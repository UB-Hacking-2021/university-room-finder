This graduate course will teach students how to do theatre history. Emphasis will be directed towards learning how to contextualize and situate sources within their historical and cultural frameworks. Some basic questions to be addressed are: what are the historian's methodologies, critical and otherwise, that may be used to conduct research in the fields of theatre and performance studies? What assumptions or interpretations are made in the process of doing theatre history? How does the research of theatre history influence our practical work as directors, dramaturges, designers, and performers? How does one decide what matters in an archive? How does archival or primary document research become evidence for and argument or thesis?","abbr":"TH","subject":"Theatre","num":"670SEM","type_pk":"SEM","type":"Seminar","grading_description":"Graded (GRD)","grading":"GRD","academic_group":"1084","academic_org":"0224","long_title":"Performance Historiography","min_credits":"3","max_credits":"3","requisites_description":null,"requisites":null,"prerequisites":null,"corequisites":null,"typically_offered":null,"fall":null,"winter":null,"spring":null,"summer":null}},"TH651":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH682":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH669":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH553":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH555":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH678":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH689":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH645":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH687":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH673":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH690":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH686":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH711":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH702":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH698":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH692":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH638":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH707":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH658":{"total":0,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[]},"TH700":{"total":4,"limit":25,"page":1,"courses":[{"_id":"618652aa9c7904001eb71c90","regnum":"21378","career":"GRAD","term_id":"2221","session":"University 15 Week Session","session_id":"1","abbr":"TH","num":"700TUT","title":"Dissertation Guidance","section":"AN","section_status":"A","alt_title":null,"instructor":"Nereson,Ariel A","institution":"University at Buffalo","location":"North Campus","campus":"North Campus","online":false,"room":"Alumni Arr","start":{"date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"end":{"date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","time":0},"when":[{"_id":"618652e69c7904001eb75546","sequence":1,"dates":{"first":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","last":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":0,"end":0},"days":{"sunday":false,"monday":false,"tuesday":false,"wednesday":false,"thursday":false,"friday":false,"saturday":false},"pattern":"ARR"}],"status":"A","enrollment":{"room":0,"section":5,"enrolled":0,"status":true},"exam":false,"notes":[],"association":"1","catalog":{"_id":"6186605a6a56f200297ad105","course_id":"301809","title":"Dissertation Guidance","description":"Directed guidance of dissertation research and writing, including the execution of the planned research as proposed in dissertation proposal and the writing of the dissertation, including review of chapters as available.
